The company began in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Florida-based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954, its two Miami-based franchisees, David Edgerton and James McLamore, purchased the company and renamed it Burger King. Over the next half century, the company would change hands four times, with its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, taking it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in BK in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company, Restaurant Brands International. At the end of fiscal year 2013, Burger King reported it had over 13,000 outlets in 79 countries; of these, 66 percent are in the United States and 99 percent are privately owned and operated with its new owners moving to an entirely franchised model in 2013. BK has historically used several variations of franchising to expand its operations. The manner in which the company licenses its franchisees varies depending on the region, with some regional franchises, known as master franchises, responsible for selling franchise sub-licenses on the company's behalf. Burger King's relationship with its franchises has not always been harmonious. Occasional spats between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances the company's and its licensees' relations have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases. Burger King's Australian franchise, Hungry Jack's, is the only franchise to operate under a different name due to a trademark dispute and a series of legal cases between the two. The Burger King menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes in 1954, to a larger, more diverse set of product offerings. In 1957, the Whopper was the first major addition to the menu; it has since become Burger King's signature product. Conversely, BK has introduced many products which failed to catch hold in the marketplace. Some of these failures in the United States have seen success in foreign markets, where BK has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. From 2002 to 2010, Burger King aggressively targeted the 18\u201334 male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. This tactic would eventually come to hurt the company's financial underpinnings and cast a negative pall on its earnings. Beginning in 2011, the company began to move away from the previous male-oriented menu and introduce new menu items, product reformulations, and packaging as part of 3G Capital's restructuring plans of the company. The 1970s were the \"Golden Age\" of Burger King advertising, but beginning in the early 1980s, the company's advertising began to lose focus; a series of less successful ad campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades. In 2003, Burger King hired the Miami-based advertising agency of Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B). CP+B completely reorganized Burger King's advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned Burger King character accompanied with a new online presence. While highly successful, some of CP+B commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity. New owner, 3G Capital, terminated the relationship with CP+B in 2011 and moved its advertising to McGarryBowen to begin a new product oriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting."], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "165296"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Carrols Restaurant Group", "neighbors": [["relation", "regionServed", "1858"], ["relation", "areaServed", "1858"], ["relation", "locationCountry", "1858"], ["relation", "type", "1457"], ["relation", "industry", "1672"], ["relation", "locationCity", "1725"], ["relation", "products", "245"], ["relation", "product", "245"], ["literal", "wordnet type", "http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-company-noun-1"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "1960"], ["literal", "abstract", "Carrols Restaurant Group is an American franchisee company and is the largest Burger King franchisee in the world; Carrols owns and operates over 650 Burger King locations across 20 U.S. states.

The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and other ingredients. Soft drinks are called \"soft\" in contrast to \"hard drinks\" (alcoholic beverages). Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic. Fruit juice, tea, and other such non-alcoholic beverages are technically soft drinks by this definition but are not generally referred to as such. Soft drinks may be served chilled, over ice cubes or at room temperature. In rare cases, some soft drinks, such as Dr Pepper, can be served warm. Soft drinks are available in many formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles (the latter in a variety of sizes ranging from small bottles to large 2-liter containers). Soft drinks are also widely available at fast food restaurants, movie theaters, convenience stores, casual dining restaurants, and bars from soda fountain machines. Soda fountain drinks are typically served in paper or plastic disposable cups in the first three venues. In casual dining restaurants and bars, soft drinks are often served in glasses. Soft drinks may be drunk with straws or sipped directly from the cups. Soft drinks are mixed with other ingredients in several contexts. In Western countries, in bars and other places where alcohol is served (e.g., airplanes, restaurants and nightclubs) many mixed drinks are made by blending a soft drink with hard liquor and serving the drink over ice. One well-known example is the rum and coke, which may also contain lime juice. Some homemade fruit punch recipes, which may or may not contain alcohol, contain a mixture of various fruit juices and soda pop (e.g., ginger ale).

Chadderton in the Middle Ages was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families who occupied them. Farming was the main industry of the area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. Chadderton's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. A late 19th century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural township into a major mill town\u2014one of several in its region\u2014and the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom. More than 50 cotton mills had been built in Chadderton by 1914. Although Chadderton's industries declined during the mid-20th century, the town continued to grow as a result of suburbanisation and urban renewal.

The territory was colonized by Spain during the sixteenth century, achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia, from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830. The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse population, with most of its 15.2 million people being mestizos, followed by large minorities of European, Amerindian, and African descendants. Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population, though thirteen Amerindian languages are also recognized, including Quichua and Shuar.

Puerto Rico is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands. The capital and largest city is San Juan. The territory does not observe daylight saving time, and its official languages are Spanish, which is predominant, and English. The island's population is approximately 3.4 million. Puerto Rico's rich history, tropical climate, diverse natural scenery, renowned traditional cuisine and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for visitors from around the world. Its location in the Caribbean, combined with centuries of colonization and subsequent migration, has made Puerto Rican culture a distinct melting pot of Amerindian, Spanish, African, and North American influences. Originally populated by the aboriginal Ta\u00edno people, the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for the Kingdom of Spain, enduring several invasion attempts by the French, Dutch, and British. During the four centuries of Spanish rule, the island's cultural and physical landscapes were transformed, with European knowledge, customs, and traditions being introduced, especially Roman Catholicism and the Spanish language. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, Spain ceded the island to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Puerto Ricans are natural-born citizens of the United States. Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. As a U.S. territory, American citizens residing on the island are \"disenfranchised at the national level\" and may not vote for the President and Vice President of the United States. However, the territory operates under a local constitution, allowing its citizens to elect a governor. A 2012 referendum showed a majority (54% of the electorate) disagreed with \"the present form of territorial status,\" with full statehood as the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status. Following this vote, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution to request the President and the Congress of the United States to end the current status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico to the Union as a State.

After acquiring Republic Airlines in 1986, Northwest also established major hubs at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and Memphis International Airport. In 1993 it began a strategic alliance with KLM and a jointly-coordinated European hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The Detroit and Minneapolis operations were retained as Delta hubs. However, the Memphis operation has been reduced from more than 300 to fewer than 21 flights a day. Prior to its merger with Delta, Northwest was the world's sixth largest airline in terms of domestic and international scheduled passenger miles flown and the US's sixth largest airline in terms of domestic passenger miles flown. In addition to operating one of the largest domestic route networks in the U.S., Northwest carried more passengers across the Pacific Ocean (5.1 million in 2004) than any other U.S. carrier, and carried more domestic air cargo than any other American passenger airline.

The country is situated in the Middle East at the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. It shares land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories (which are claimed by the State of Palestine and are partially controlled by Israel) comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. It contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while Jerusalem is both its self-designated capital (unrecognised by the United Nations) and the most populous individual city under the country's governmental administration. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is internationally disputed. On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine. This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the Executive Head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,\" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956\u201357, 1967\u201382), part of South Lebanon (1982\u20132000), Gaza Strip (1967-2005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel\u2019s occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times. The population of Israel, as defined by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, was estimated in 2014 to be 8,146,300 people. It is the world's only Jewish-majority state, with 6,212,000 citizens, or 74.9% of Israelis, being designated as Jewish. The country's second largest group of citizens are denoted as Arabs, numbering 1,718,400 people (including the Druze and most East Jerusalem Arabs). The great majority of Israeli Arabs are settled Sunni Muslims, with smaller but significant numbers of semi-settled Negev Bedouins; the rest are Christians and Druze. Other far smaller minorities include Maronites, Samaritans, Dom people and Roma, Black Hebrew Israelites, other Sub-Saharan Africans, Armenians, Circassians, Vietnamese boat people, and others. Israel also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia. In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and Democratic State. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage. The Prime Minister serves as head of government and the Knesset serves as the legislative body.

The differing character in the neighborhoods of Queens is reflected by its diverse housing stock ranging from high-rise apartment buildings, especially prominent in the more densely urban areas of western and central Queens, such as Jackson Heights, Flushing, Astoria, and Long Island City, to large, free-standing single-family homes, common in the eastern part of the borough, in neighborhoods that have a more suburban layout like neighboring Nassau County, such as Little Neck, Douglaston, and Bayside.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The country's constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. Driven by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower. The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.

Although Lancaster is still the county town, the county's administrative centre is Preston. The county has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of 1,189 square miles (3,080 km2). People from the county are known as Lancastrians. The history of Lancashire begins with its founding in the 12th century. In the Domesday Book of 1086, some of its lands were treated as part of Yorkshire. The land that lay between the Ribble and Mersey, Inter Ripam et Mersam was included in the returns for Cheshire. When its boundaries were established, it bordered Cumberland, Westmorland, Yorkshire and Cheshire. Lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the Industrial Revolution. Manchester and Liverpool grew into its largest cities, dominating global trade and the birth of modern capitalism. The county contained several mill towns and the collieries of the Lancashire Coalfield. By the 1830s, approximately 85% of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in Lancashire. Accrington, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Bury, Chorley, Colne, Darwen, Nelson, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale and Wigan were major cotton mill towns during this time. Blackpool was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of Lancashire's mill towns, particularly during wakes week. The county was subject to significant boundary reform in 1974 that removed Liverpool and Manchester and most of their surrounding conurbations to form the metropolitan counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The detached northern part of Lancashire in the Lake District, including the Furness Peninsula and Cartmel, was merged with Cumberland and Westmorland to form Cumbria. Lancashire lost 709 square miles of land to other counties, about two fifths of its original area, although it did gain some land from the West Riding of Yorkshire. Today the county borders Cumbria to the north, Greater Manchester and Merseyside to the south and North and West Yorkshire to the east; with a coastline on the Irish Sea to the west. The county palatine boundaries remain the same[clarification needed] with the Duke of Lancaster exercising sovereignty rights, including the appointment of lords lieutenant in Greater Manchester and Merseyside."], ["literal", "areaTotalKm", "3079"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/areaTotal", "3079.0"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "707256776"], ["literal", "location", "England"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "50435"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Javone Prince", "neighbors": [["relation", "birthName", "901"], ["literal", "genre", "Sitcom"], ["literal", "abstract", "Javone Prince is a British comedian and actor.

The factory still features pure granite \"Conching\" machines which are over 60 years old but are still in use. Due to its long history, and the general appeal of Chocolate, the factory is a major Tasmanian tourism attraction for families. Following Cadbury UK's successful 1922 merger with rival chocolatiers, Fry's, Cadbury's decided to expand overseas. As Australia was one of the company's largest export markets, it was decided to be an appropriate location for their new operations. Tasmania was chosen as the location following extensive research, due to the state's cheap provision of hydro electricity by the Hydro Electric Commission, cool climate and the availability of high-quality fresh dairy production and supply. The building of the new complex was a massive undertaking, and the new facility was modelled upon Cadbury's Bournville facilities, down to the provision of housing, shops, and sports and other facilities for the employees. The new estate was called \"Cadbury's Estate\" and was located on the banks of the Derwent River in Claremont to the north of Glenorchy.

The company commands approximately 1% of the Japanese beer market. However, it controls 60% of the beer market on Okinawa. \u201cThere\u2019s only one full-size Okinawan brewery, and Orion Breweries churns out 72 million liters of fresh beer each year to please the palates of Okinawan beer drinkers\u201d. Orion Beer is \u201ccharacterized by a crisp refreshing feel and mild taste. The alcohol content is 5.0%. Hops used to create this beer are Hallertaurer hops from Germany and the malt is carefully selected from the highest quality European and Australian varieties\u201d. Orion uses water that \u201ccomes from springs\u201d out of the mountain \u201cjust behind the brewery\u201d. Like many breweries, Orion likes to give some credit for the quality of its beer to the source of its water. Orion also has its own ingredients and techniques that could be what makes it special. Founded in 1957 in Nago, Okinawa during the American occupation of Okinawa, Orion began making beer in 1959. Orion struggled to compete with the other major Japanese breweries, but after changing from a German-style beer to an American-style beer, it gained the top share in the Okinawan market. Orion became the most widely consumed beer in Okinawa, and \u201cthe company\u2019s popularity took off as the brew became a more American style beer\u201d, but until 2002, it had a market that was limited to mostly Okinawa. Since 2002, Orion has worked together with Asahi Breweries to manufacture Asahi beers in Okinawa, in return for Asahi's assistance in selling Orion beer outside of Okinawa. Orion made an agreement with Asahi Breweries to increase its market, and it is now distributed much more widely in Japan but had yet to capture a lot of attention in international market. \u201cWhile Orion Breweries maintains its independence in Okinawa, it is now distributed outside of Okinawa through the Asahi company\u201d. As a popular beer to those who have been exposed to it in Okinawa, it has great market potential. Some go to great means to be able to acquire this beer in other places. There are many people who prefer it over all other beers, and Orion beer appears to have a great future now that it is being distributed by Asahi Breweries in markets outside of Okinawa. \u201cAt the Orion Beer Nago Factory, specially-selected quality barley and hops from Europe are thoroughly matured in the strictly-controlled brewery process to create beer with flavor that goes well with the climate of the subtropical Okinawa\u201d. The factory then provides a tour where tourists \u201ccan participate\u2026 and learn about the ingredients from the staff and also observe the brewery process\u201d. Orion Beer emphasizes recycling all its waste, producing \"zero elimination\". For example, most bottles are tried to be recycled and plastic crates delivering bottles are melted down and re-cast as new crates.[citation needed] The Orion Company is well known for being environmentally friendly and recycles everything. There are many collection centers where the bottles and plastic cases are returned to be recycled. \u201cRecycling is a byword at Orion, with everything being allocated a second life after the beer\u2019s been brewed. Hops, yeast, malt and grains mash are recycled as fertilizers or animal feed, while glass beer bottles are cleaned and sterilized and used an average of 20 times. Even the old, worn plastic beer cases are ground down and remolded into something else\u201d. Orion Beer has been featured in professional wrestling, as Okinawan wrestler Menso-re Oyaji regularly carries an Orion Beer can with him to the ring during his matches. Akihito Yagi, 7th Dan in Meibukan Goju Ryu Karate-do, which his late grandfather (Meitoku Yagi) created, and who is the current chairman of the International Meibukan Goju Ryu Karate Association (IMGKA), is a spokesman for Orion beer."]], "text": ""}, {"name": "White Rock Beverages", "neighbors": [["relation", "locationCountry", "1858"], ["literal", "wordnet type", "http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-company-noun-1"], ["literal", "foundation", "1871"], ["literal", "products", "Seltzer, Soft drinks"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "684110305"], ["literal", "homepage", "http://www.whiterockbeverages.com/"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "9009480"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "1871"], ["literal", "abstract", "White Rock Beverages (White Rock Products Corporation) is an American beverage company located in Whitestone, NY.

Its first restaurant was a haunt of pianist Glenn Gould. The flagship location was opened in 1940 by G. Francis \"Fran\" Deck at 21 St Clair Avenue West and closed in 2001. Fran's, originally beginning as a diner, had only ten seats, but later expanded to a small chain of restaurants in Toronto, including locations at 2275 Yonge and Eglinton, (1945-2001) 1386 Bathurst south of Vaughan Road, Yonge and College (1950\u2013present), Yonge and Dundas (1960-1984) and one in Hamilton with their head office being on Mt Pleasant Road north of Merton Street. Currently, Fran's operates five corporate-owned locations, including four in Toronto, and one in Barrie, Ontario. Fran Deck died in 1976 in a car accident in Tucson, Arizona; the business was continued by his family. In the 1990s, the family-owned chain was sold to a group of investors who intended to expand the chain throughout the Greater Toronto Area. In 1997, the College St. location was purchased by an independent restaurateur, Joon Kim. The College St. location retained the Fran's menu and restaurant name. In 1998, the Fran's Restaurant company was purchased by the owner of the College St. location. Once again, Fran's Restaurant became a family-owned and operated restaurant and is today owned by Joon Kim and his sons. Because of the proximity of the College St. location to Maple Leaf Gardens, many of its clients were hockey fans catching a meal before or after a Maple Leafs hockey game. Moreover, many of its long-time customers continued to frequent the location. In 2004, as a part of a gradual expansion program, a new location was opened in the Pantages Hotels and Suites at Victoria and Shuter. With the opening, Fran's modified its menu to include new food items alongside its traditional favourites by doubling the food choice. Following the opening of the Victoria and Shuter location, Fran's expanded to Barrie, Ontario, opening a restaurant on Bayfield Street in December 2006. This location became the first location that is not open 24 hours a day. Closed 2015. In 2009 Fran's Restaurants opened its first corporate United States location in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, in the Power & Light Entertainment District. In August 2010, Fran's opened its third Toronto-based location near the intersection of Yonge and Front Streets, across from the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts. Along with its modern decor, it also the first Fran's Restaurant to have a full-service bar in its substantial outdoor patio. This location is the first to expand its brand from a diner concept to a restaurant and bar and includes a full size outdoor bar and patio with both patio table and lounge chair configurations. Fran's Restaurant is the originator of the term \"Banquet Burger\".[citation needed] Fran's was a constant haunt of pianist Glenn Gould. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation profile of Gould notes: In 2014, Fran's opened a booth at the Canadian National Exhibition's Food Building for the first time and will feature exclusive fare developed especially for the fair such as pie shakes, peanut butter-Sriracha balls, a Thanksgiving waffle and a Big Breakfast Maple Toast Box."], ["literal", "products", "Steaks"], ["literal", "name", "Fran's Restaurant Food Corporation"], ["literal", "foundation", "Toronto"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "1940"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "669638971"], ["literal", "product", "Breakfast"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Horseshoe sandwich", "neighbors": [["relation", "ingredient", "791"], ["relation", "country", "1858"], ["relation", "name", "829"], ["literal", "abstract", "The horseshoe is an open-faced sandwich originating from Springfield, Illinois, United States.

Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture. There are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients, and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread. As a result, there are wide varieties of types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads in various regions. Bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in sourdough recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened, either for preference, or for traditional or religious reasons. Many non-cereal ingredients may be included, ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats. Commercial bread in particular commonly contains additives, some of them non-nutritional, to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, or ease of manufacturing. Depending on local custom and convenience, bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day. It also is eaten as a snack, or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking, or the bland main component of a bread pudding, or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away. Partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff, bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition; it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture. Its prominence in daily life is reflected in language, where it appears in proverbs, colloquial expressions (\"He stole the bread from my mouth\"), in prayer (\"Give us this day our daily bread\") and even in the etymology of words, such as \"companion\" and \"company\" (from Latin com \"with\" + panis \"bread\")."], ["literal", "ingredient", "Water"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "36969"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Korb_mit_Br\u00f6tchen.JPG?width=300"], ["literal", "ingredientName", "Flour,water"], ["literal", "mainIngredient", "Water"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "706629865"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Hero Certified Burgers", "neighbors": [["relation", "name", "819"], ["relation", "product", "1449"], ["relation", "industry", "1503"], ["literal", "foundation", "Yorkville, Ontario, Canada in 2004"], ["literal", "abstract", "Hero Certified Burgers is a quick service restaurant franchise chain that operates in Canada, with locations concentrated in Southern Ontario.

Aside from adding a few awnings, outdoor heaters, and a new colour scheme the building is still the same as it was when it was built. Even the menu is largely unchanged, with current co-owner Peter Loubardeas boasting that \"[o]ur top 10 items have been the same for, I\u2019m going to say, the past 40 years,\" Loubardeas, along with his father Gus, bought the restaurant in 2005 from Jim Douglas who ran it for more than 42 years, following in the footsteps of his father, H.W.

Their signs advertised \"Winky's Hamburger 15\u00a2\"; other sandwiches offered were The Big Wink, The Great One, and The Ground Rounder. Hot dogs also were on the menu. One of the television commercials for the chain featured a puppet monster reading a list of signs featuring the names of the towns where restaurants were located. Upon learning that there was no Winky's in Wilmerding, the monster ate the panel, exclaiming, \"There's no Winky's in Wilmerding!\" Winky's started as a sideline of the Jiffy Steak Company, a meat company that the Erensteins had originally started in the back of their family's grocery store in Ambridge, Pennsylvania after the end of World War II. By the 1960s, Jiffy was distributing fresh and frozen meats in 31 states. In 1961, they had noticed that a new hamburger chain located in Virginia was purchasing an unusually large amount of hamburger patties on a regular basis. That chain was a McDonald's franchise. The brothers decided that they could do the same thing in Western Pennsylvania. The first Winky's was opened in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania in February 1962, offering 15-cent hamburgers. What gave their restaurant chain an advantage at that time was that their chain had their own meat supply. By 1965, Winky's had 14 locations with 4 under construction. Although most of the locations were company owned, the company began to offer franchises. Within two years, the company had 32 restaurants around Pittsburgh with 9 under construction and were in discussions in trying to expand nationally through franchising. At its height in 1977, the company had 42 stores in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.

It includes 16 constituent states and covers an area of 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi) with a largely temperate seasonal climate. Its capital and largest city is Berlin. With about 81.5 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state in the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular migration destination in the world. Various Germanic tribes have occupied northern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. The rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted in the unification of many of the German states in 1871 into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The establishment of the national socialist dictatorship in 1933 led to World War II and systematic genocide. After 1945, Germany split into two states, East Germany and West Germany. In 1990, the country was reunified. In the 21st century, Germany is a great power and has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society. It upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection and a tuition-free university education. Germany was a founding member of the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, and the OECD.

This sandwich is not well known outside of this relatively small area of New England. This sandwich was created to provide a low cost meal in an economically depressed region inhabited by recent immigrants from Europe and Canada while providing it in a form with which they were already familiar. Even the gravy has been modified to be very similar to that used in typical New England cooking. These sandwiches are sometimes served outside of Chinese American restaurants by the food services in local area schools and senior citizens' centers. Celebrity chef and Fall River native Emeril Lagasse has also publicized this sandwich, along with food writers Jane and Michael Stern. The sandwiches are served \"strained\" or \"unstrained,\" referring to whether or not the sandwich has vegetables. \"Strained\" means that it is served without vegetables. Just like plated chow mein without the bun, the sandwich may also include meats or seafood, usually chicken, beef, or shrimp. The Oriental Chow Mein Noodle Company of Fall River is the regional source for the sandwich's distinctive crispy noodles. These sandwiches can be found in the cities of Fall River, New Bedford, and Taunton in Massachusetts; and in the cities of Woonsocket, Pawtucket and Tiverton in Rhode Island. Although the sandwich is unknown in nearby Boston, it was listed the menu at the more distant Coney Island location of Nathan's Famous in Brooklyn, New York as recently as 2013.

It was an East Coast regional fast food restaurant and had 359 company-owned locations when Marriott Corporation acquired it in 1982. Marriott discontinued the brand and converted locations to its Roy Rogers Restaurants chain. The last Gino's, located in Pasadena, Maryland and owned independently from Marriott, closed in 1986. In the early 1970s, the company attempted to expand into the midwest, however these locations only operated a short period. For one location, it purchased Orchestra Hall in Detroit and planned to demolish the structure to construct a restaurant. When the plan became public, it led to a grass-roots campaign to save and restore the abandoned structure. The restaurant was known for high-quality hamburgers such as the Sirloiner, which was made from sirloin steak, and the Gino Giant, which predated and later competed with the Big Mac. The company held the franchise for Kentucky Fried Chicken in the Mid-Atlantic states. The company\u2019s jingle, played during radio advertisements in the early years was \u201cEverybody goes to Gino\u2019s, \u2018cause Gino\u2019s is the place to go!\" The original menu included french fries made fresh in each restaurant.

It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts several of the EU's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO. Belgium covers an area of 30,528 square kilometres (11,787 sq mi) and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. Belgium is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. It is divided in three regions and three communities, that exist next to each other. Its two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region.A German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia.Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of government. Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands, the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, causing it to be dubbed the \"Battlefield of Europe,\"a reputation strengthened by both world wars. Upon its independence, Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolutionand, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by differences in language and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms, resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups remain; the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election."], ["literal", "populationDensitySqMi", "941.6799999999999"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "3343"], ["literal", "areaTotal", "30528189856.53043"], ["literal", "areaSqMi", "11787"], ["literal", "longName", "Kingdom of Belgium"], ["literal", "populationDensity", "363.6"], ["literal", "percentageOfAreaWater", "6.400000095367432"], ["literal", "imageFlag", "Flag of Belgium.svg"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/populationDensity", "363.6"], ["literal", "motto", "(literally, \"Unity makes strength\")"], ["literal", "areaKm", "30528"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "707519639"], ["literal", "currency", "Euro"], ["literal", "leader", "Charles Michel"], ["literal", "capital", "Brusselsb"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flag_of_Belgium.svg?width=300"], ["literal", "foundingDate", "1839-04-19"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "Prime Minister"], ["literal", "timeZone", "Central European Time"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "Monarchy of Belgium"], ["literal", "capital", "City of Brussels"], ["literal", "establishedDate", "1839-04-19"], ["literal", "populationDensityKm", "363.6"], ["literal", "language", "Dutch language"], ["literal", "officialLanguage", "Dutch language"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/areaTotal", "30528.189856530433"], ["literal", "governmentType", "Parliamentary system"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "https://web.archive.org/web/20070720161347/http:/www.geogr.uni-goettingen.de/kus/personen/euregio/emr99-21.htm"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Chicken in the Rough", "neighbors": [["relation", "product", "680"], ["relation", "name", "360"], ["literal", "products", "Fried chicken, shoestring potatoes, biscuits and honey"], ["literal", "abstract", "Chicken in the Rough, also known as Beverly's Chicken in the Rough, is a fried chicken restaurant chain and former franchise.

Commonly made from pork, the meat is cubed or chopped, salted heavily and cooked slowly in fat until it is tender enough to be easily shredded, and then cooled with enough of the fat to form a paste. They are normally used as spread on bread or toast and served at room temperature. Rillettes are also made with other meats, goose, duck, chicken, game birds, rabbit and sometimes with fish such as anchovies, tuna or salmon. Sarthe (Le Mans), Tours, and Anjou, all in central France, are notable sources of rillettes. The term rillette perhaps refers to the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly over low heat until very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In Anjou, rillaud was a speciality, plated in the shape of a pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish. Like cassoulet or fondue, this French dish has its many regional definitions. In general most rillettes are served at room temperature, as a spread with toast points, much like a p\u00e2t\u00e9. Pork rillettes from the northwestern regions of Tours and Anjou are famous for the rich texture and bronze color achieved during the cooking process. Rabelais called rillettes \"the brown jam from the pig\" (brune confiture de cochon). Rillettes from the adjacent d\u00e9partement of Sarthe are distinguished by a more rustic texture, complete with larger pieces of pork and less color. In Quebec, cretons are similar to rillettes. The French word rillettes is first evidenced in 1845. It derives from the Old French rille, meaning a slice of pork, which is first attested in 1480. This is a dialect variation of the Old French reille, meaning a lath or strip of wood, from the Latin regula. The word rillettes is thus cognate or linked with the English words rail, referring to railways, and ruler, meaning a straight strip of wood for measuring."]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Chicken and waffles", "neighbors": [["relation", "hasVariant", "680"], ["relation", "country", "1858"], ["relation", "ingredient", "351"], ["literal", "mainIngredient", "Chicken, waffles"], ["literal", "servingTemperature", "Hot"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "4271344"], ["literal", "ingredientName", "Chicken,waffles"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "705651809"], ["literal", "abstract", "Chicken and waffles refers to either of two American dishes - one from soul food, the other Pennsylvania Dutch - that combine chicken with waffles.

Animals are divided into various sub-groups, some of which are: vertebrates (birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish); molluscs (clams, oysters, octopuses, squid, snails); arthropods (millipedes, centipedes, insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, lobsters, shrimp); annelids (earthworms, leeches); sponges; and jellyfish."], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Animal_diversity.png?width=300"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "708436660"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "11039790"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Inghams Enterprises", "neighbors": [["literal", "numberOfEmployees", "9000"], ["literal", "product", "Fodder"], ["literal", "foundation", "1918"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "698623473"], ["literal", "name", "Inghams Enterprises Pty Limited"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.inghams.com.au"], ["literal", "abstract", "Inghams Enterprises, commonly known as Inghams, is owned by an American private equity firm (TPG Capital) and supplier/producer of poultry and fodder.

Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs. True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago, and the last common ancestor is estimated to have lived about 95 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds radiated extensively around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like \"stem-birds\" that lie outside class Aves proper, in the group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early stem-birds, such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks and long bony tails. Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moas and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, give most birds the ability to fly, although further speciation has led to some flightless birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins, and also members of the duck family, have also evolved for swimming. Birds, specifically Darwin's finches, played an important part in the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have polygynous (\"many females\") or, rarely, polyandrous (\"many males\") breeding systems. Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilized, though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring. Many species of birds are economically important. Domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) are important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertilizer. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120\u2013130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them.

It is one of the most popular Polish soups and is served on family dinners and also is a traditional soup for weddings. It is also said to be a great remedy if one catches a cold. The name \"ros\u00f3\u0142\" derives from a dish made of salted meat (old conservation method) cooked in water to make it more edible. Later fresh meat was used instead of salted. Much later that dish of cooked meat became a soup that we know today.

The cooking must take at least six hours of sensitive boiling on small fire. At the end there must be added softly burnt onion. Ros\u00f3\u0142 my\u015bliwski (The hunter's ros\u00f3\u0142), made of variety of wild birds as well as pheasant, capercaillie, wood grouse, black grouse or grey partridge, with small addition of roe deer meat, couple of wild mushrooms, 2-3 juniper fruits. Instead of wild poultry helmeted guineafowl can be used. The most important thing about making ros\u00f3\u0142 is that there can be no addition of pork, since that could make ros\u00f3\u0142 not clear. It also cannot be boiling too fast because of the same reason. So, on to the recipe from year 1682[citation needed]: This is the way to cook Polish ros\u00f3\u0142: take beef meat or veal,hazel grouse or partridge, and whatever meat that in ros\u00f3\u0142 can be cooked.Soak it, lay in pot, then strain and pour over meat, add parsley, butter, salt, and skim well.One has to know what to put in the ros\u00f3\u0142 for it not to smell.that is parsley, dill, onion or garlic, nutmeg or rosmarin or pepper to taste.Lime would not spoil any ros\u00f3\u0142 as well."], ["literal", "ingredientName", "Chicken,noodle,broth"], ["literal", "ingredient", "Noodle"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "675562210"], ["literal", "servingTemperature", "Hot"], ["literal", "country", "Poland"], ["literal", "course", "Soup"], ["literal", "type", "Soup"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/09516_rosol_z_makaronem,_sanok.jpg?width=300"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "26403"], ["literal", "alias", "Ros\u00f3\u0142 z kury, Ros\u00f3\u0142 kr\u00f3lewski, Ros\u00f3\u0142 my\u015bliwski"], ["literal", "mainIngredient", "Noodle"], ["literal", "served", "Hot"], ["literal", "alternateName", "Ros\u00f3\u0142 z kury, Ros\u00f3\u0142 kr\u00f3lewski, Ros\u00f3\u0142 my\u015bliwski"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "K-Bob's Steakhouse", "neighbors": [["relation", "locationCountry", "1858"], ["relation", "industry", "1503"], ["relation", "name", "958"], ["literal", "locationCity", "Santa Fe, New Mexico"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "23542618"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/K-Bobs,_Raton,_NM_IMG_5000.JPG?width=300"], ["literal", "abstract", "K-Bob\u2019s Steakhouse is a regional restaurant chain that operates in the cattle country of Texas and New Mexico.

Ray J. Russell established Freshslice Pizza with a purpose of developing a new fast-food concept. His goal was to combine pizza delivery with self-serve dining. The Freshslice franchising model is unique in that franchisees pay 0% royalty rates, 0% marketing royalties and are provided with free marketing materials. This is done through an in house dough manufacturing system that is the holder of Canadian patents. The head office also maintains a policy of accepting no \"kick backs\" from outside food vendors, allowing the franchisees to profit on the improved margin. Freshslice has been awarded the Consumer Choice Awards for Business Excellence in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2013 it was awarded the Best By The Slice in Vancouver by Georgia Straight Magazine.

The European part of France, called metropolitan France, extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. France spans 643,801 square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and has a total population of 66.6 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. The Constitution of France establishes the state as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. During the Iron Age, what is now Metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The Gauls were conquered in 51 BC by the Roman Empire, which held Gaul until 486. The Gallo-Romans faced raids and migration from the Germanic Franks, who dominated the region for hundreds of years, eventually creating the medieval Kingdom of France. France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) strengthening French state-building and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy. During the Renaissance, France experienced a vast cultural development and established the beginning of a global colonial empire. The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power under Louis XIV. French philosophers played a key role in the Age of Enlightenment during the 18th century. In the late 18th century, the absolute monarchy was overthrown in the French Revolution. Among its legacies was the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, one of the earliest documents on human rights, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France became one of modern history's earliest republics until Napoleon took power and launched the First French Empire in 1804. Fighting against a complex set of coalitions during the Napoleonic Wars, he dominated European affairs for over a decade and had a long-lasting impact on Western culture. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments: the monarchy was restored, it was replaced in 1830 by a constitutional monarchy, then briefly by a Second Republic, and then by a Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was established in 1870. The French republic had tumultuous relationships with the Catholic Church from the dechristianization of France during the French Revolution to the 1905 law establishing la\u00efcit\u00e9. La\u00efcit\u00e9 is a strict but consensual form of secularism, which is nowadays an important federative principle in the modern French society. France reached its territorial height during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it ultimately possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. In World War I, France was one of the main winners as part of the Triple Entente alliance fighting against the Central Powers. France was also one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Following World War II, most of the French colonial empire became decolonized. Throughout its long history, France has been a leading global center of culture, making significant contributions to art, science, and philosophy. It hosts Europe's third-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites (after Italy and Spain) and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually, the most of any country in the world. France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence. It is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity. According to Credit Suisse, France is the fourth wealthiest nation in the world in terms of aggregate household wealth. It also possesses the world's largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), covering 11,691,000 square kilometres (4,514,000 sq mi). French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

It has also opened in Paraguay and in Miami in the U.S. The company experienced difficulties after the implementation of the Real Plan. With the fall in inflation, earnings decreased and the model used by the partners proved to be unviable, soon as the company went into receivership.[citation needed] In 1996, due to financial crisis, the chain was sold to three friends of the owners: Felipe Barreto, Luciana Morais e Luciana Vasconcelos. The trio, completely inexperienced in the business, invested in the franchise system to grow and in 1998 broke the ten unique shops in possession of the company inherited from the former administration. In 2002, the chain had the highest growth proportional in the national segment, and in 2003 the chain achieved 21% growth, opening the first stores in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Paran\u00e1. In 2004 and 2005, the company's main focus was the diversification of products, including a Giraffas ice cream kiosk. In 2005 was opened the first store in the town of Barreiras, in Bahia. In 2006, the chain celebrated 25 years with a festival of local rock bands in Bras\u00edlia, called Giraffestival. At the same time the company reached the milestone of 200 stores throughout Brazil and inaugurated the first stores in Par\u00e1 and Mato Grosso.

The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes. History The first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the small beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico\u2019s northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe P\u00e9rez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere. Many of El Meson\u2019s early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed.

The chain was founded as PIZZABOX in Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina in 1992. The idea of selling pizza slices did not achieve the expected results and the entrepreneurs had to rethink the concept of business due to the presence of a close competitor that got wide success with the sale of pastries. A new alternative was planned with the idea of selling calzones. At first production was made in a small place on the mezzanine. On day one, they sold seven calzones. In subsequent months, the production was increased until the space was no longer enough, leading to its transfer to a restaurant in 1993. In 1994, the trademark \"Mini Kalzone\" was created and the calzones came to be called as Mini Kalzones. Following the growth in the formation of a fast food chain, until January 2000 were opened seven stores in the state of Santa Catarina. In June 2000, the company opens its first store in Cear\u00e1 state, with the construction of a production center and two shops in the city of Fortaleza.

Rubio's was voted \"Best of the Best (Cheap Eats)\" in the June 2008 issue of San Diego Magazine. Its headquarters are in Carlsbad. According to founder Ralph Rubio, he and some friends from San Diego State University were on spring break in San Felipe when he first encountered fish tacos at a local stand, and was inspired to open a restaurant serving them in his hometown, San Diego, California. Since then, the popularity of fish tacos has spread throughout California, although they remain uncommon elsewhere. Rubio's standard fish tacos are made from Alaskan pollock, which is battered, fried, and served in a corn tortilla, although optionally offered with a flour tortilla. Grilled mahi-mahi is also available at all locations. The first Rubio's restaurant was opened in 1983 at a former Orange Julius site on Mission Bay Drive in the Pacific Beach area of San Diego. The first restaurant offered French fries, calamari, and fish tacos, among other cuisine. In 2005, a class action lawsuit was brought against the company complaining that the \"Lobster Burrito\" offered at the restaurant contained squat lobster (also known as Langostino) rather than clawed lobster from the Nephropidae family. Rubio's subsequently changed the name of their product to the \"Langostino Lobster Burrito\" to avoid future confusion. The burrito is currently only occasionally sold as a \"limited time offer\".

He opened a grocery store in 1919 to sell specialty items, but soon found particular success with gourmet coffee roasting. After Van Houtte's death in 1944, his family continued to operate and develop the Maison A.L. Van Houtte business. In 1980, the family business evolved into a corporation known as A.L Van Houtte Inc., led by Paul-Andr\u00e9 Guillotte and Beno\u00eet Beauregard. Its corporate name was shortened to Van Houtte Inc. following a shareholder vote on 12 September 2000. Today, Van Houtte has grown into an international supplier of coffee, coffee machines and related support for over 60,000 offices and other places of employment in the United States and Canada. The company claims this to be the largest such system in North America. Van Houtte also supplies and supports coffee sales for cafeterias, grocery and convenience stores, restaurants and hotels. Van Houtte also offers a selection of fair-traded coffee products. Van Houtte still sells coffee directly to customers through its chain of caf\u00e9s throughout Quebec. Van Houtte also offers coffee and associated products for sale through its website. In May 2007, U.S. private equity firm Littlejohn & Co. announced a $600 million deal that will take Van Houtte ownership out of Canadian hands, although the gourmet coffee company will continue to have headquarters in Montreal under its existing name and have the leadership of its current management team.

Its height was planned at 386 metres (1,265 ft), with 92 floors, which means it would have been 21st in the world today, and would be overtaken in Europe by the Federation Tower. A public viewing platform was planned for 1000 ft above ground level. The scheme featured a highly unorthodox floor layout, essentially two asymmetrical ellipses joined at one end. When the plans were first unveiled in 1996, the Guardian newspaper coined the term \"erotic gherkin\", a name that was quickly taken up by other media and which stuck even after the plan was superseded, eventually becoming The Gherkin, the popular name for the different design of building that stands on the site today. English Heritage had been one of the largest backers of the project until they withdrew their support, due to Heathrow Airport objecting to the disruption that such a tall building would have on their flight paths.

He opened up shop at the corner of Lake and Beach Avenues, across the street from Ontario Beach Park, which at the time was an amusement park that drew crowds of people from all over the state. Abbott next opened up several shops in the Playland at Rye Beach. He never lost his interest in horse racing, and in 1952 his horse Blue Man won the Preakness Stakes, earning him $86,135. In 1957, Leonard and Thelma Schreiber became the owners of Abbott's Frozen Custard and started franchising Abbott's locations. The first franchise was at 630 W. Ridge Rd in Rochester. That location closed in 2012. Other franchises would follow, along with other additions that contributed to the business. In 1981, Thelma Schreiber unveiled the \"Turtle\" dessert.

The restaurant includes two main dining rooms, two private dining rooms, and a two-storey underground wine cellar housing over 30,000 bottles in 30 foot tall racks, with antique chandeliers, and a dining table for exclusive parties. Harry Barberian was the youngest of four children born to Armenian refugee parents. After working as manager-chef at Le Baron steakhouse, Barberian bought a cottage at 7 Elm Street for $6,000 and founded his own restaurant. Patrons over the years have included Robert Morley, James Beard, Rudolf Nureyev, Veronica Tennant, Mick Jagger, Denzel Washington, Eminem and every Canadian prime minister since John Diefenbaker. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were engaged at the restaurant in 1964. The restaurant houses a collection of rare Canadiana including original paintings by the Group of Seven. Current proprietor Arron Barberian has become a minor YouTube celebrity due to two incidents: the first, in which, during the Toronto Blue Jays 2013 home opener he comically wielded a bat which had flown into the stands after Cleveland Indians\u2019 second baseman Jason Kipnis accidentally let go of it during a swing and the second when security cameras filmed him chasing and fighting back against a would-be mugger who had attempted to rob him.

Arron Barberian has managed the restaurant since 1993 when his family bought back a controlling share twenty years after his father, Harry, had sold a majority share of the establishment and gone into retirement. The younger Barberian expanded the restaurant by building the wine cellar at a cost of $1.5 million.

Jay Call and headquartered in Ogden, Utah. A lifelong fan of aviation, Call named it Flying J in honor of the aviation industry. It sought Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy protection in December 2008, blaming its financial woes on the collapse in oil prices and tighter credit markets. Pre-bankruptcy, Flying J was the largest retailer of diesel fuel in North America with approximately 220 locations in the United States and Canada and 15,000 employees. The company produces and refines petroleum products for its truck stops and offers a number of pricing plans for owner/operators and trucking companies. The company also offers vehicle maintenance, banking, insurance and telecommunications services for the trucking industry, and a number of restaurants at its locations. The company had sales of $18.0 billion in 2008, but record prices for crude oil and a crumbling demand for gasoline eroded margins and affected cash flow. Founder Jay Call died in a mysterious and tragic jet plane accident in 2003. The company ranked 13th on Forbes' 2009 list of the largest privately held companies in the U.S.with 2008 revenues of approximately $18.00 billion.

With more than 50 locations, it was once the largest restaurant chain based in Oregon. It was a Denny's-style restaurant, a type that was commonly known at that time as a \"coffee shop\" but is now more commonly known as a casual dining restaurant. Most restaurants were located near freeways and were open 24 hours. At its peak, the chain had locations in five states: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada and northern California. The first VIP's Restaurant was opened in 1968, in Tualatin, Oregon, next to an Interstate 5 freeway interchange. A second restaurant was opened the same year, in Salem, in a location not near a freeway. It was not as profitable as the Tualatin location, and consequently the company's owners decided that future restaurants should be placed along freeways. By 1969, the chain was expanding outside Oregon, with two VIP's under construction in Seattle, and by late 1971 it had grown to 15 restaurants. The company, founded by Keith Andler and Robert Smith, was named VIP's Restaurants, Inc. By 1982, the company was operating 53 VIP's coffee-shop-style restaurants and had also opened four Mexican restaurants that had other names, including La Casa Real and Tortilla Machine. Together, the 57 restaurants had gross sales of more than $41 million in 1981. In 1982, the company sold 35 of its 53 VIP's Restaurants to Denny's Inc. for around $12 million. The offer from Denny's was \"too good to pass up\", VIPs' owners told The Oregonian newspaper, including a promise that all employees at the affected restaurants would keep their jobs and be absorbed by Denny's. The 1982 sale covered 19 locations in Washington and 16 in Oregon and Northern California. In 1984, VIP's sold 16 restaurants to JB's Restaurants, of Salt Lake City. This sale, of eight locations in Oregon (including the original Tualatin location) and eight in Washington, left the company with just nine restaurants. By 1989, the last VIP's Restaurants had been sold, and the company had branched out into the hotel business. Renamed VIP's Industries Inc., the company continued to own a few Tex-Mex restaurants, using the name La Casa Real and mostly located in the Portland\u2013Vancouver metropolitan area but with ones also in Fife, Washington, and Salem. The entire six-restaurant La Casa Real chain was sold in December 1994 to Chevy's, which was expanding rapidly in the Portland metropolitan area at that time. Earlier, VIP's Industries had opened a chain of hotels, Phoenix Inn (later: Phoenix Inn Suites), which was targeted at business travelers and had six locations in the Portland metropolitan area, including one in Vancouver, Washington. Based in Wilsonville, Oregon, Phoenix Inn was a subsidiary of VIP's Industries.

Teany made a brief appearance in Moby's 18 B Sides + DVD. In January 2006, Teany was refocused as more of a traditional tea house and offered less food. Kelly took on a larger role on the business side of Teany with Moby taking a smaller one. On June 19, 2009 a fire caused minimal damage to the tea house. Nobody was hurt and, according to Moby's online journal, it was Kelly's decision whether the cafe was going to be rebuilt or not. The tea house reopened in May 2010. The beverage company distributes tea-juice mixtures to a number of shops around New York and New Jersey. In 2005, UK-based suburb secured an exclusive deal to sell Teany beverages and tea at its stores in Manchester and London. The company allows liberal pronunciation of the brand name, proclaiming, \u201cyou can pronounce it however you like. tea-knee. tee-nee. tea-enn-why,\u201d and going on to state that Moby and Kelly themselves pronounce it \u201cteenie\u201d.[citation needed]"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "727073"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "2002"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Wayne's Coffee", "neighbors": [["relation", "name", "1924"], ["relation", "industry", "1503"], ["literal", "wordnet type", "http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-company-noun-1"], ["literal", "foundationPlace", "Stockholm"], ["literal", "industry", "Restaurants"], ["literal", "foundation", "Stockholm"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.waynescoffee.com/"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Waynes_coffee.jpg?width=300"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "684708927"], ["literal", "location", "Stockholm, Sweden"], ["literal", "type", "Privately held company"], ["literal", "location", "Stockholm"], ["literal", "abstract", "Wayne's Coffee is a Swedish-based coffeehouse chain founded in Stockholm at Kungsgatan in 1994.

The first restaurant was opened in Sunnyvale, California, in 1986 by Martin Culver, Brad Wells, and Ken Oppeltz. The group took over the former Calaway's Bar and Grill in a small shopping center on El Camino Real in Sunnyvale. Opening the first restaurant for under $140,000 using funds from Martin Culver's home equity line of credit, a cash investment from Brad Wells, and the restaurant background of Ken Oppeltz, the restaurant was an immediate success. The lines out the door prompted the trio to quickly search for a second location which was opened in the Moffett Business Park. Shortly thereafter, the group was approached by a venture capital group and raised several rounds of financing for expansion. Over a few years, Fresh Choice expanded to over 50 locations in California, Texas, and Washington. Fresh Choice marketed itself as a healthier alternative to fast food restaurants with reference to menu options that include choices relatively low in fat, carbohydrates, and/or calories. All restaurants featured 50 foot salad bars, 6 freshly made soups daily, artisan pizza, and breads. Fresh Choice obtained its produce from local farmers, and tried to use seasonal, local and organically grown produce. In 2009, the company embarked on a plan to grow many of its own vegetables. The Sacramento Magazine Diners' Choice Awards voted Fresh Choice as the restaurant with the most health-conscious menu in 2008 and 2009. Fresh Choice was enrolled in PG&E's Climate Smart Program, through which Fresh Choice made voluntary, charitable contributions that fund greenhouse gas capture and reduction projects to make its Northern California restaurants' energy usage carbon neutral. Additionally, Fresh Choice sponsored and participated in events such as 2009 Earth Day in Sacramento, California International Marathon and health fairs. Fresh Choice's major competitor was Sweet Tomatoes (known as Souplantation in Southern California). In late 2012, Fresh Choice closed approximately half its locations. According to the Capitola-Soquel Patch Fresh Choice planned re-organizing the restaurants into a new concept of \u00e0 la carte fare and charging people by the pound for their salads. They would also have a beer and wine bar, a breakfast bar, and updated seating. Some locations that had been open less than two years closed and one location which was supposed to open in Stockton was permanently shelved according to the company. On December 15, 2012, it was reported that all Fresh Choice locations would be closing permanently, and that two of them in the Bay Area had been re-opened under the name \"California Fresh\" As of September 2014, California Fresh has at least seven restaurants in the Bay Area."], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Freshchoice.JPG?width=300"], ["literal", "locationCity", "Emeryville, California"], ["literal", "extinctionYear", "2012"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "4667317"], ["literal", "defunct", "2012"], ["literal", "foundation", "Sunnyvale, California, USA"], ["literal", "keyPeople", "Sandy Boyd, CEO"], ["literal", "type", "Privately held company"], ["literal", "foundationPlace", "Sunnyvale, California"], ["literal", "keyPerson", "Chief executive officer"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Illegal Pete's", "neighbors": [["relation", "locationCountry", "1858"], ["relation", "industry", "1503"], ["relation", "name", "858"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "36864544"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "1995"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.illegalpetes.com/"], ["literal", "locationCity", "Denver"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "701378391"], ["literal", "foundation", "Colorado"], ["literal", "type", "Privately held company"], ["literal", "abstract", "Illegal Pete\u2019s is a Colorado-based group of quick-service \"Mission Style\" burrito restaurants that takes inspiration from burritos popularized in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s."], ["literal", "foundationPlace", "Colorado"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Pilot Corporation", "neighbors": [["relation", "regionServed", "1858"], ["relation", "name", "1403"], ["relation", "areaServed", "1858"], ["relation", "locationCountry", "1858"], ["relation", "subsidiary", "1404"], ["relation", "subsid", "1404"], ["literal", "type", "Privately held company"], ["literal", "foundation", "Gate City, Virginia, 1958"], ["literal", "numEmployees", "19000"], ["literal", "locationCity", "Knoxville, Tennessee"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "1958"], ["literal", "keyPeople", "Jimmy Haslam"], ["literal", "founder", "Jim Haslam"], ["literal", "assets", "4.1E9"], ["literal", "foundedBy", "Jim Haslam"], ["literal", "revenue", "1.777E10"], ["literal", "industry", "Convenience store"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "3518343"], ["literal", "foundationPlace", "Gate City, Virginia"], ["literal", "numberOfLocations", "550"], ["literal", "operatingIncome", "4.75E8"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "699687551"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.pilotcorp.com"], ["literal", "abstract", "Pilot Corporation (or simply Pilot) is a petroleum corporation in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States.

The chain was founded by its namesake, Leeann Chin, funded by Carl Pohlad (banker and former owner of the Minnesota Twins) and actor Sean Connery. The concept received Best Chinese Food and Best Takeout Food as well as being voted No. 80 in a list of the country\u2019s top 100 by fast casual restaurant industry website FastCasual.com in 2011. It is currently owned by Los Angeles-based financier, West Coast Capital principal and former investment banker Lorne Goldberg, who also owns the popular Asian chains Pick Up Stix and Mandarin Express. The chain offers chicken entrees, in addition to beef and shrimp options, prepared in Mongolian, Hunan, and Szechuan styles from mild to spicy. The restaurant recently added low calorie options and has their own proprietary frozen yogurt named Red Cherry. The concept was founded by Leeann Chin, a Chinese immigrant who moved to Minnesota in 1957. She opened her first location in Minnetonka, Minnesota in 1980 and another in St. Paul in 1984. General Mills bought the name to her restaurants and the restaurants in 1984 with plans to expand the chain nationally. However, locations opened in Chicago faltered and General Mills put an end to the opening new restaurants. The restaurants and name were bought back from General Mills by Leeann Chin Inc. in 1988, by Chin with the help of Capital Dimensions Venture Fund. Lorne Goldberg bought the chain in 2007. Goldberg invested about $8 million in the chain and quickly revitalized the decor of the restaurants and improved its menu, introducing new items that were initially developed for Mandarin Express\u2019 restaurants. The new items and location remodels quickly accounted for an increase of about 20 percent of sales. Goldberg also moved away from operating takeout counters within Lunds and Byerly\u2019s grocery stores. In 2011, Leeann Chin Inc. began to expand outside of its base in Minnesota\u2019s Twin Cities with opening of its Fargo, North Dakota restaurant and later opened a location in Duluth, Minnesota. In 2013, the chain launched its AsiaFit menu, a selection of low calorie (400 calories) stir-fry dishes, following a trend among casual-dining restaurants for lighter, healthier meals.

The club originally earned a reputation as one of Canada's hippest music clubs, and many major Canadian comedy and musical performers have played on its stage, including The Kids in the Hall, Gordon Downie, The Frantics, Sean Cullen and the infamous Dark Shows. The Drowsy Chaperone premiered at The Rivoli and went on to subsequent productions and eventually a highly successful run on Broadway. In the 1980s, the Rivoli was synonymous with Toronto's black-garbed Queen West scene (Mike Myers' Saturday Night Live German club character Dieter was inspired by a Rivoli waiter)[citation needed]. This reputation waned as the club's clientele became more eclectic and upscale, but the Rivoli's atmosphere is still unique.[citation needed] Talent scouts for Montreal's Just For Laughs comedy festival and the major television networks still routinely troll the Monday night comedy shows.[citation needed] From 1987 to 1990 the Journal of Wild Culture held its regular avant-garde vaudeville nights, the Caf\u00e9 of Wild Culture, featuring a mix of artists exploring the magazine's ecology and imagination mandate. Since the 1990s the Rivoli has been home to The ALTdot COMedy Lounge, Toronto's most popular alternative comedy show[citation needed]. In 2005, a second weekly show was added, The Sketch Comedy Lounge. The venue is divided into three main areas, the front, the upstairs and the back. The front of the venue has a bar along most of its west wall. The east side of the front room, separated from the bar by a dividing wall, are tables for dining. Upstairs there is a pool hall with 11 vintage and antique tables. The space is large and sometimes dance nights or private parties are hosted there. The back room of the venue contains a stage at the back. There is a smaller bar in the back room, and some bar seating along the side walls. The audience area is sometimes open for standing room, sometimes tables and chairs are set up, and sometimes chairs are set up in rows. Seating is rarely assigned or reserved. Patrons are typically free to eat or drink in the front room without paying for admission to shows.

Cruz, who was not a chef himself, established Caf\u00e9 Adriatico in Malate, Manila in 1979. The venture proved successful and helped revitalize the Malate area, other restaurants and cafes opening in the vicinity in the midst of the Adriatico's success. Cruz expanded his restaurant business with the opening of several other restaurants within Metro Manila through the LJC Restaurant Group. At the time of his death in 2008, Cruz had opened fourteen restaurants in the Philippines. Several of his restaurants featured Filipino and Kapampangan cuisine. In the late 1980s, Cruz published Metro Magazine, a city guide/political/lifestyle magazine inspired by New York Magazine and Vanity Fair. He later sold the magazine to Eugenio Lopez, Jr. in order to finance the expansion of his restaurants. Upon his death on February 4, 2008, following complications from cancer, Cruz was hailed at the time of his death as the leading Filipino \"pioneer in theme or concept restaurants\" and the man who had \"shaped Philippine caf\u00e9 society\"."], ["literal", "birthDate", "1941-09-17"], ["literal", "shortDescription", "Filipino restaurateur"], ["literal", "placeOfBirth", "Philippines"], ["literal", "name", "Cruz, Larry J."], ["literal", "deathDate", "2008-02-04"], ["literal", "deathYear", "2008"], ["literal", "occupation", "Journalist"], ["literal", "dateOfBirth", "1941-09-17"], ["literal", "dateOfDeath", "2008-02-04"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "The Park Hotels", "neighbors": [["relation", "name", "1783"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.expresshospitality.com/20060630/industryleaders%27speak13.shtml"], ["literal", "foundationPlace", "Kolkata"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "26405050"], ["literal", "intl", "yes"], ["literal", "keyPeople", "Vijay Dewan"], ["literal", "locationCity", "Kolkata"], ["literal", "areaServed", "India"], ["literal", "type", "Limited company"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "708059708"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/The_Park_Hotels.jpg?width=300"], ["literal", "internationally", "true"], ["literal", "foundingYear", "1967"], ["literal", "locationCountry", "India"], ["literal", "foundingDate", "1967-11-01"], ["literal", "homepage", "http://www.theparkhotels.com/"], ["literal", "foundation", "Kolkata"], ["literal", "abstract", "The Park Hotels is a collection of contemporary luxury five-star boutique hotels in India belonging to the Apeejay Surrendra Group, headquartered in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

The menu eventually incorporated hamburgers, and then shifted into a barbecue restaurant. The second restaurant opened in February 1963. From the beginning, Bill Miller Bar-B-Q was a family business. Faye Miller served as a cashier and hostess while raising their four children. The children learned how to work and were raised learning the operations of the business. They worked in the restaurant during the summers and on weekends. When Miller planned a vacation to Europe between Balous Miller's junior and senior years of college, Balous ran the restaurant business that summer and then decided to make Bill Miller Bar-B-Q his career rather than going to teaching school. Miller semi-retired upon Balous' graduation in May 1966. As his brothers, John and Douglas received their degrees, they joined him in the restaurant business.

Its headquarters are in the K&W Corporate Office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. K&W serves traditional Southern favorites including fried chicken, turnip greens, fried okra, and homemade desserts. Grady T. Allred, Sr., a founder of K&W Cafeterias, entered the restaurant business on Thanksgiving Day 1935 as an employee of a small restaurant on Cherry Street in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Carolinian Coffee Shop was owned by brothers Thomas, Kenneth and William Wilson and their brother-in-law T.K. Knight. In 1937, the initials K&W (for Knight and Wilson) were adopted and K&W Restaurant was established. Allred later acquired a one-third interest in the K&W Restaurant. After operating the restaurant with his partners for a few years, Allred purchased their interests and became the sole owner of K&W Restaurant around the year 1941. The K&W Restaurant continued to flourish at the Winston-Salem Cherry Street location until fire damage forced it to close for several months. After repairs and restoration were completed, it reopened as a restaurant/cafeteria combination. The cafeteria concept of the operation became so popular and successful that Allred decided to convert the unit entirely to cafeteria style food service. K&W occupied its original location in Winston-Salem until an urban renewal project forced a move to 720 Coliseum Drive in Winston-Salem. On January 18, 1988, the K&W located at 380 Knollwood Street in Winston-Salem exploded due to a natural gas leak. The restaurant was destroyed and the attached Sheraton hotel was severely damaged. The blast occurred while the restaurant was closed. Of the four persons in the lobby/cafeteria building at the time of the explosion, three sustained minor injuries. A fourth person sustained a fractured ankle. Both the restaurant and the hotel were damaged beyond repair and were subsequently demolished. In 1991, K&W began offering takeout service through the To Go Shop. In 2009, K&W Catering began, for events such as weddings and corporate meetings. While other cafeteria chains went bankrupt during the 1980s and 1990s, K&W continued to prosper. From the original restaurant establishment, which seated 110 people, K&W has expanded to 35 cafeterias and over 2500 employees throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and formerly Maryland.

The bars feature a combination of classic arcade games and draft beer from local and regional American microbreweries. The original Barcade opened in 2004 in a former metal shop at 388 Union Avenue in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and won immediate acclaim for its unique combination of vintage arcade games and rare American craft beers. The company is owned and operated by four long-time friends, brothers Kevin Beard and Scott Beard, Pete Langway and Paul Kermizian, who is also the director of the 2004 documentary film American Beer about the American craft beer industry. Twenty-five beers are available on draft and cask at each location and are chosen exclusively from American craft breweries. The selection leans towards locals from the northeast including Brooklyn Brewery, Sixpoint Brewery, Cape Ann Brewing, Dogfish Head, Victory Brewing, Climax Brewing, River Horse Brewing Company, and Captain Lawrence Brewing. Some examples of the arcade games originally featured at Barcade in Brooklyn are Tapper, Q*bert, Donkey Kong, Tetris, Robotron: 2084, Centipede, Super Mario Bros., 1943, Berzerk, Frogger, Rampage, Tetris and Star Wars. In 2010, it was announced that two other Barcade locations would be opened by the owners, the first in downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, and the second in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Jersey City location opened on April 22, 2011. The Philadelphia location opened on October 10, 2011. In December 2012, it was reported that Barcade was expanding again, with a location in Manhattan planned for 2013, although that location was delayed and did not open until June 2014. A second Manhattan location was announced in spring 2014 and opened in October of that year. This one was different than the other Barcade locations, with a focus on classic fighters and games from the 1990s. In June 2015, it was announced that a Barcade location would be opening in New Haven, Connecticut. Many world record holders and world-class gamers can be found at the Brooklyn location. There is a high score board on display and many of the names on it are well known world record holders. Plastic surgeon and Barcade regular Hank Chien set the world record in Donkey Kong with a score of 1,061,700 in March 2010. Chien can often be found at Barcade, practicing his skills on the Donkey Kong machine, wearing his operating scrubs. Thirty-eight-year-old George Leutz set the world record on Q*bert in February 2013 with a score of 37,163,080 after spending years practicing on the machine in Brooklyn's Barcade. Joshua Lombay set the world record for the 1984 Midway game Timber in June 2013 with a score of 9,767,550 after having discovered the game and playing for the first time at Barcade in Brooklyn. Barcade first filed for a federal trademark of its name for use in bars and restaurants on July 20, 2007. and the mark quickly became well known, even in markets outside of where Barcade operated. By 2012, the success of the Barcade chain had inspired other similarly themed bar and arcade combination businesses to open in other cities in the U.S., with many of these places citing the original Barcade location as their inspiration. New arcade bars directly inspired by Barcade opened in Las Vegas, Denver, Kentucky, California, Maine, Iowa, Vermont and Oregon. Two opened in Chicago in one year, one of them dubbing itself a \"Beercade\" and the other, called Emporium, being opened by a former Barcade employee. Very similar to Barcade, Emporium \"follows that well-oiled model almost identically, serving up about three dozen classic arcade coin-ops plus numerous beers on tap.\" Soon, even regular corner bars started to add vintage arcade games in an attempt to cash in on the trend, and Details Magazine named arcade bars as one of the hot cocktail trends to watch in 2015. A few of this new wave of bar and arcade businesses attempted to use the Barcade name, causing confusion as to who was operating these locations, but Barcade successfully defended its trademark in these instances. Other new arcade bars launched with similar names, figuring out ways to not infringe on the trademark. In addition to the \"Beercade\" in Chicago, a San Francisco company launched as \"Brewcade\" in 2014. The press and industry looked for other names to call these arcade bar hybrids, with the DNA Association branding them \"social-tainment\" and also referring to them as \"game bars\". Most began referring to them as \"arcade bars\", and Barcade is typically credited with having been the first \"arcade bar\". Barcade launched its own app for the iPhone in May 2014."]], "text": ""}, {"name": "O'Charley's", "neighbors": [["relation", "locationCountry", "1858"], ["relation", "name", "1307"], ["relation", "industry", "1503"], ["literal", "netIncome", "-3.49E7"], ["literal", "foundedBy", "Charley Watkins"], ["literal", "equity", "1.782E8"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "2155730"], ["literal", "abstract", "O'Charley's is a casual dining restaurants chain in the United States, with more than 200+ company-owned locations.

Pastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture. A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry.

There are conflicting stories about the dessert's origin. Some claim that it was first served during the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where the ice cream sundae was also invented. Though in 1894 a Philadelphia company was given credit for its invention describing : \"A small, solid cake of the [ice] cream is enveloped in a thin sheet of pie crust and then dipped into boiling lard or butter to cook the outside to a crisp. Served immediately, the ice cream is found to be as solidly frozen as it was first prepared.\". A third claim, beginning in the 1960s asserts that fried ice cream was invented by Japanese tempura restaurants. In the United States, fried ice cream has been associated with Asian cuisine, appearing in reviews of Chinese, Japanese, and Polynesian restaurants in the \"Dining Out\" section of the New York Times in the 1970s. It also came to be associated with Mexican cuisine, in large part due to national chain Chi-Chi's adopting a fried ice cream made with tortillas and cinnamon as its \"signature dessert\" when it opened in the early 1980s. The connection with Asian cuisine is also reflected in Australia. The dessert is commonly made by taking a scoop of ice cream frozen well below the temperature at which ice cream is generally kept, possibly coating it in raw egg, rolling it in cornflakes or cookie crumbs, and briefly deep frying it. The extremely low temperature of the ice cream prevents it from melting while being fried. It may be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and a touch of peppermint, though whipped cream or honey may be used as well. The Asian recipe usually uses tempura batter. Mexican versions use corn flakes, nuts, cookie crumbs, or tortillas for coating. Common flavours in Asian restaurants are green tea, vanilla, taro and red bean.

Risalamande was created in the last part of the 19th century. It is made out of rice pudding mixed with whipped cream, vanilla, and chopped almonds; and is usually served cold with a cherry sauce (kirseb\u00e6rsovs). It gained popularity when rice pudding became more common. Until then rice pudding had been a very exclusive dish, as making it required two expensive, imported ingredients: rice and cinnamon. After World War II, risalamande experienced an increase in popularity, being touted as a \"savings\" dessert: adding whipped cream (which was easily available) to the still fairly expensive rice would make the rice last longer. In order to minimize costs, risalamande was frequently made without almonds during this time, too.[citation needed] A similar traditional Danish Christmas dish, risengr\u00f8d, is essentially risalamande before the whipped cream, vanilla, and almonds have been added, and is typically served hot, topped with cinnamon and butter. Nowadays, it is very common to make a large batch of rice pudding for dinner on lillejuleaften (\"Little Christmas Eve\", i.e. December 23), a part of which is kept until Christmas Eve and used to make risalamande, which is eaten as dessert after the big Christmas dinner.

The syrup and taffy produced from a Manitoba Maple are generally darker and have a mustier flavour than that which is made from sugar maples.

The thick liquid may be kept hot over a very low flame or in a pan of hot water, but should not be stirred as it will form grainy crystals.

Once sufficiently hardened the candy can be picked up and eaten. The higher a temperature one boils the initial syrup, the thicker the final result will be.

This practice has been traced back to the pre-Islamic Persia. The wheat is soaked and prepared for days and so the entire process takes up to a week. Traditionally, the final cooking would take from late in the evening till the daylight and was a party, involving only women. This would be full of laughter and music and singing related songs. In Uzbekistan the whole gathering, mostly women, gather near the huge pot: sit in a circle, sing songs, have fun, each of them waits for their turn to stir the sumalak. In the morning still warm sumalak is handed out to neighbors, relatives and friends. In Tajikistan and Afghanistan they sing: Samanak dar J\u016bsh u m\u0101 Kafcha zan\u0113m \u2013 D\u012bgar\u0101n dar Khw\u0101b u m\u0101 Dafcha zan\u0113m. (meaning: \"Samanak is boiling and we are stirring it, others are asleep and we are playing daf\"). The Azerbaijani proverb: Samani, Samani, har il goyardaram sani, translated by the Oxford Symposium on Food & Cookery (1989); \"Samani, Samani, I try to make you grow every year.\", refers to the annual renewal of nature. In modern times, making Samanu can be a family activity. Traditional Samanu is made entirely of germinated wheat and water (no other ingredients). Nowadays, it is common to add a bit of flour to speed up the thickening process, although this makes the paste taste somewhat bitter and less sweet.

Some recipes also include egg whites and/or butter. In late 19th and early 20th century England, home-made lemon curd was traditionally served with bread or scones at afternoon tea as an alternative to jam, and as a filling for cakes, small pastries and tarts. Homemade lemon curd was usually made in relatively small amounts as it did not keep as well as jam. In more modern times, larger quantities became possible because of the use of refrigeration. Commercially manufactured curds often contain additional preservatives and thickening agents. Contemporary commercially made curds remain a popular spread for bread, scones, toast, waffles, crumpets, pancakes, cheesecake or muffins. They can also be used as a flavoring for desserts or yogurt. Lemon-meringue pie, made with lemon curd and topped with meringue, has been a popular dessert in Britain and the United States since the nineteenth century. Lemon curd can also have whipped cream folded into it for such uses as filling cream puffs. Curds differ from pie fillings or custards in that they contain a higher proportion of juice and zest, which gives them a more intense flavor. Also, curds containing butter have a smoother and creamier texture than both pie fillings and custards, which contain little or no butter and use cornstarch or flour for thickening.

The original Yule log recipe emerged during the 19th century.[citation needed] It is traditionally made from a genoise, generally baked in a large, shallow Swiss roll pan, iced, rolled to form a cylinder, and iced again on the outside. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate buttercream, though many variations which include chocolate cake, ganache, and icings flavored with espresso or liqueurs exist. Yule logs are often served with one end cut off and set atop the cake, or protruding from its side to resemble a chopped off branch. A bark-like texture is often produced by dragging a fork through the icing, and powdered sugar sprinkled to resemble snow. Other cake decorations may include actual tree branches, fresh berries, and mushrooms made of meringue or marzipan. The name b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl originally referred to the Yule log itself, and was transferred to the dessert only after the custom had fallen out of use, presumably during the first half of the 20th century.

Such rich brioche-like breads are also traditional in many other countries, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic. Examples of similar breads from other cultures include badnji kruh in Croatian cuisine, folar de p\u00e1scoa in Portuguese cuisine, brioche in French cuisine, kulich in Russian cuisine, panettone in Italian cuisine, and challah in Jewish cuisine. Cozonac is a sweet bread, into which milk, eggs, sugar, butter, and other ingredients are mixed together before baking. In Bulgaria, the kozunak is prepared by adding lemon zest to the dough mixture, just as the Romanian version. The Italian Panettone is very similar to the basic cozonac, the most visible difference being their shapes. In Romania, the recipes differ rather significantly between regions in what concerns the trimmings. The dough is essentially similar throughout the country; a plain sweet bread made from flour, eggs, milk, butter, sugar and salt. Depending on the region, one may add to it any of the following: raisins, rahat, grated orange or lemon rind, walnuts or hazelnuts, and vanilla or rum flavor. Cozonac may be sprinkled with poppy seeds on top. Other styles dictate the use of a filling, usually a ground walnut mixture with ground poppy seeds, cocoa powder, rum essence, or raisins. The dough is rolled flat with a pin, the filling is spread and the whole is rolled back into a shape vaguely resembling a pinwheel. In the baked product, the filling forms a swirl adding to the character of the bread.

There are also several brands of ready-made pizzelle available in stores. Pizzelle are popular during Christmas and Easter. They are often found at Italian weddings, alongside other traditional pastries such as cannoli and traditional Italian cookies.

'calf dance') is a classical Scandinavian dessert. It is made from unpasteurized colostrum milk, the first milk produced by a cow after giving birth. Kalvdans has a long tradition in Swedish cuisine. It is mentioned in the encyclopedia Project af swensk grammatica from 1682. The encyclopedia mentions 'kalvost' (lit. calf-cheese) as an alternative name. The name kalvdans refers to the jiggly pudding-like constistency of the dessert. Swedish emigrants brought the tradition of kalvdans to North America, as well. It is however rarely consumed today, as very few families keep cows of their own. In preparing the dessert, the colostrum milk is mixed with water and carefully heated. Due to the high levels of protein in the colostrum milk, it coagulates and hardens when boiled (much like eggs do). Thus the dessert gets a pudding-like consistency. Due to Swedish health regulations, unpasteurized milk may only be sold directly from the farms. Thus the capacity to produce kalvdans is somewhat limited. As a consequence kalvdans is very rarely prepared in Swedish households today. In 2008 kalvdans, along with four other Swedish dishes, was included in the 'Ark of Taste' of the Slow Food movement. A related dessert is r\u00e5mj\u00f6lkspannkaka. Similar desserts like kalvdans exists in other countries. In Iceland, a pudding called \u00c1brystir is made out of colostrum milk. In England colostrum milk, or beestings as it is called locally, was traditionally used for puddings. In India Junnu is a dessert made out of colostrum milk from buffaloes.

Sutarpheni is one of the Indian analogues of the Turish pismaniye, which uses wheat flour instead of rice flour, and the Persian pashmak, which substitutes sesame paste for wheat flour. The choice of rice flour as the source of starch is not critical, and regular white (wheat) flour may be substituted. Sohan papdi is similar except that it uses a mixture of chickpea flour and wheat flour as the starting material instead of rice flour. The original recipe may have been brought to India following the numerous waves of invasions of Northern India by the Islamic rulers of Central Asia and Persia from the 9th through the 18th centuries CE. The threads of pismaniye, however, are considerably finer than those of sutarfeni, because the gluten in wheat flour allows the pastry strands to be thinner without falling apart . The addition of cardamom as a flavoring agent is a typically Indian touch. Without special equipment to melt the sugar/flour mixture and spin it into threads, making sutarpheni can be laborious and the recipe is unsuitable for preparation at home.

There are many regional variations, but they all include puff pastry base and custard cream. In Croatia, two most popular variants are Samoborska krem\u0161nita from the town of Samobor and Zagreba\u010dka krem\u0161nita from the capital, Zagreb. The extremely popular Samoborska krem\u0161nita is characterized by having a puff pastry top, predominantly custard cream filling (less whipped cream) and is finished with powdered sugar. Zagreba\u010dka krem\u0161nita has a characteristic chocolate icing instead of the puff pastry top, while maintaining the puff pastry base. The classic recipe for Samoborska krem\u0161nita is considered to be designed by \u0110uro Luka\u010di\u0107 in the early 1950es, based on different earlier variants found in patisseries of Zagreb. In Slovenia, kremna rezina is commonly associated with the town of Bled, an Alpine tourist destination in northwestern Slovenia. The recipe cake was brought to the local Hotel Park in 1953 by I\u0161tvan Kova\u010devi\u010d, chef of the hotel's confectionery store. He came to Bled from Serbia where a similar cake was already known. As of October 2009, 10 million cream cakes have been baked at the hotel's patisserie since its invention. The name of the dessert means simply \"cream slice\". Most locals refer to it as krem\u0161nita, from the German word Cremeschnitte, with the same meaning. In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro, the dish is known as krempita 'cream pie'. It is usually prepared with puff pastry dough. The filling is usually pure thick custard, less commonly combined with meringue (whipped egg whites and sugar) creme.

The 2008 economic downturn saw the reappearance of Arctic Roll as consumers increasingly looked for low-cost foods. While some consumers view the Arctic Roll as comfort food, others view it as old fashioned and the food writer Nigel Slater has even described it as tasting of \"frozen carpet\". Nonetheless, Birds Eye reported \"overwhelming consumer demand\" for the dessert. Indeed, from when Birds Eye started marketing Arctic Rolls again in December 2008 until April 2009, sales of the product were estimated at \u00a33.5 million, or 3 million boxes (around 250 miles of Arctic Roll).

Since 2011, Jones has starred in Scott & Bailey as DC Rachel Bailey, with the television series being an original idea conceived by Jones herself and fellow actress Sally Lindsay. Jones also received acclaim for her portrayal of a human incarnation of the iconic TARDIS in a 2011 episode of long-running BBC science fiction series Doctor Who.

Although a 20th-century creation, the borough has Neolithic, Bronze Age and Roman heritage. It encompasses several former mill towns, which expanded and coalesced during the late-19th century as a result of population growth and advances in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Although some parts contiguous with the city of Manchester are highly industrialised and densely populated, about two-thirds of the borough is composed of rural open space; the eastern half stretches across the South Pennines. For its first 12 years the borough had a two-tier system of local government; Oldham Council shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. Since the Local Government Act 1985 Oldham Council has effectively been a unitary authority, serving as the sole executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local policy, setting council tax, and allocating budget in the district. The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham has two civil parishes and 20 electoral wards.

He wrote a number of highly influential textbooks, and was particularly important in the development of the theory of instinct and of social psychology in the English-speaking world. He was an opponent of behaviourism and stands somewhat outside the mainstream of the development of Anglo-American psychological thought in the first half of the 20th century; but his work was very well known and respected among lay people. McDougall was educated at Owens College, Manchester and St John's College, Cambridge. He also studied medicine and physiology in London and G\u00f6ttingen. After teaching at University College London and Oxford, he was recruited to occupy the William James chair of psychology at Harvard University in 1920, where he served as a professor of psychology from 1920 to 1927.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state\u2014the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 93,800 square miles (243,000 km2), the UK is the 80th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 64.5 million inhabitants. The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with an urban population of 10,310,000, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. The current monarch\u2014since 6 February 1952\u2014is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the country, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has fourteen Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies. The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, currently ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific, and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fifth or sixth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member state of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO)."], ["literal", "populationDensityKm", "255.6"], ["literal", "timeZone", "Greenwich Mean Time"], ["literal", "populationDensity", "255.6"], ["literal", "currency", "Pound sterling"], ["literal", "establishedDate", "1801-01-01"], ["literal", "populationDensitySqMi", "661.9"], ["literal", "areaKm", "242495"], ["literal", "ethnicGroupsYear", "2011"], ["literal", "demonym", "Briton"], ["literal", "ethnicGroupsInYear", "2011"], ["literal", "language", "English language"], ["literal", "populationEstimate", "64716000"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg?width=300"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "Prime Minister"], ["literal", "anthem", "God Save the Queen"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/areaTotal", "242495.406794539"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"], ["literal", "leader", "David Cameron"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "708210519"], ["literal", "populationTotal", "64716000"], ["literal", "leaderName", "David Cameron"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/populationDensity", "255.6"], ["literal", "percentageOfAreaWater", "1.340000033378601"], ["literal", "flag", "Flag of the United Kingdom.svg"], ["literal", "areaSqMi", "93628"], ["literal", "imageFlag", "Flag of the United Kingdom.svg"], ["literal", "governmentType", "Parliamentary system"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "31717"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Hulme", "neighbors": [["relation", "country", "1857"], ["relation", "officialName", "842"], ["relation", "metropolitanBorough", "1125"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Hulme_Arch_Beetham_in_sunset.jpg?width=300"], ["literal", "postalCode", "M15"], ["literal", "abstract", "Hulme is an inner city area and electoral ward of Manchester, England, immediately south of Manchester city centre.

She was the founder and first president of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, through which she led a longstanding campaign against the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). A staunch social conservative, she was disparagingly termed a reactionary by her socially liberal opponents. Her motivation derived from her traditional Christian beliefs, her aversion to the rapid social and political changes in British society of the 1960s and her work as a teacher of sex education. Born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, Whitehouse became an art teacher, at the same time becoming involved in evangelical Christian groups such as the Student Christian Movement and Moral Re-Armament. She became a public figure via the Clean-Up TV pressure group, established in 1964, in which she was the most prominent figure. The following year she founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for what she perceived as a lack of accountability, and excessive use of bad language and portrayals of sex and violence in its programmes. As a result, she became an object of mockery in the media. During the 1970s she broadened her activities, and was a leading figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light, a Christian campaign that gained mass support for a period. She initiated a successful private prosecution against Gay News on the grounds of blasphemous libel, the first such case for more than 50 years. Another private prosecution was against the director of the play The Romans in Britain, which had been performed at the National Theatre, which she withdrew when it became clear she was about to lose. Whitehouse's campaigns continue to divide opinion. Her critics have accused her of being a highly censorious figure, and her traditional moral convictions brought her into direct conflict with advocates of the sexual revolution, feminism and gay rights. Others see her more positively and believe she was attempting to halt a decline in what they perceived as Britain's moral standards. According to Ben Thompson, the editor of an anthology of Whitehouse-related letters, in 2012: \"From Mumsnet to ... feminist anti-pornography campaigns [and] the executive naming and shaming strategies of UK Uncut, her ideological and tactical influence has been discernible in all sorts of unexpected places in recent years.\""], ["literal", "deathPlace", "Essex"], ["literal", "deathDate", "2001-11-23"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "243919"], ["literal", "birthName", "Constance Mary Hutcheson"], ["literal", "religion", "Anglicanism"], ["literal", "deathYear", "2001"], ["literal", "birthDate", "1910-06-13"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "702760072"], ["literal", "birthYear", "1910"], ["literal", "birthPlace", "Nuneaton"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "European University Association", "neighbors": [["relation", "name", "603"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "714765"], ["literal", "headquarter", "Brussels"], ["literal", "formation", "2001"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.eua.be/eua-membership-and-services/Home/members-directory.aspx"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "Vice-President"], ["literal", "headquarters", "Brussels"], ["literal", "abstract", "The European University Association (EUA) represents and supports more than 850 institutions of higher education in 47 countries, providing them with a forum for cooperation and exchange of information on higher education and research policies.

It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council. The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium, which was established in about 79 AD on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. It was historically a part of Lancashire, although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated during the 20th century. Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand \"at an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. Manchester achieved city status in 1853, the first new British city for three hundred years. The Manchester Ship Canal, at the time the longest river navigation canal in the world, opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to sea, 36 miles (58 km) to the west. Its fortunes declined after the Second World War however, owing to deindustrialisation, but investment spurred by the 1996 Manchester bombing led to extensive regeneration. In 2014 the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Manchester as a beta world city and consequently as the highest-ranked British city apart from London. Its metropolitan economy is the second biggest in England according to the ONS. Manchester is the third-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors, after London and Edinburgh. It is notable for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections.

Yemen is the second largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km2 (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east. Although Yemen's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015. Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra. Yemen was the home of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and probably also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish influenced Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the 4th century AD whereas Judaism and local paganism were already established. Islam spread quickly in the 7th century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult. Several dynasties emerged from the 9th to 16th century, the Rasulid being the strongest and most prosperous. The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early 20th century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of Yemen Arab Republic in 1962. South Yemen remained a British protectorate until 1967. The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990. Yemen is a developing country. Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described as a kleptocracy. According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men: president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who controlled the state; major general Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the army; and sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players, including tribal sheikhs. The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which to weigh in on Yemen's political decision making. Yemen has been in a state of political crisis since 2011. In January 2011, a series of street protests began against poverty, unemployment, corruption and president Saleh's plan to amend Yemen's constitution and eliminate presidential term limit, in effect making him president for life. He was also grooming his eldest son Ahmed Saleh, the commander of the Republican Guard, to succeed him. The United States considers Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to be the \"most dangerous of all the franchises of Al-Qaeda\". The U.S sought a controlled transition that would enable their counter-terrorism operations to continue, while Saudi Arabia's main concern was to maintain its influence in Yemen through some old regime figures and other tribal leaders who were part of the so-called \"GCC initiative\". President Saleh stepped down, the transition quickly proceeded per the \"GCC Initiative\"; the powers of the presidency were transferred to Vice President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was formally elected president on 21 February 2012 in a one-man election. The interim parliament conferred immunity on president Saleh and 500 of his associates that same month. A National Dialogue Conference was launched on 18 March 2012 to reach consensus on major issues facing the country's future. In January 2014, the National Dialogue Conference extended Hadi\u2019s term for another year. The transitional process was disrupted by conflicts between the Houthis and Islah, as well as the al-Qaeda insurgency. In September 2014, the Houthis took over Sana'a, forcing Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar to flee the country, and prompted the formation of a new \"unity government\" including a variety of Yemeni factions. A draft constitution was discussed that would split Yemen into six federal regions, but the Houthis rejected the proposal. Hadi, his prime minister and cabinet resigned on 22 January 2015 amid a political impasse against the Houthis and ongoing violence in the capital. Three weeks later, the Houthis declared themselves in control of the government in what Abdul-Malik al-Houthi called a \"glorious revolution\", although opposition politicians, neighbouring states, and the United Nations decried the takeover as a coup d'\u00e9tat. Most of Yemen's political factions and the international community have refused to recognise the Houthis' authority, and UN-brokered talks on a power-sharing deal are ongoing. However, on 21 February, Hadi rescinded his resignation and declared he was still the legitimate president in Aden. Hadi called on government institutions to gather in Aden, which he proclaimed on 21 March 2015 was Yemen's \"economic and temporary capital\" while Sana'a remains under Houthi control."], ["literal", "areaKm", "528076"], ["literal", "establishedDate", "1967-11-30"], ["literal", "capital", "Aden"], ["literal", "populationDensityKm", "44.7"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/areaTotal", "528076.0"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flag_of_Yemen.svg?width=300"], ["literal", "areaSqMi", "203796"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "350939"], ["literal", "nationalAnthem", "al-Jumh\u016br\u012byah al-Mutta\u1e25idah"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/populationDensity", "44.7"], ["literal", "officialLanguage", "Arabic"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Temple Society of Concord", "neighbors": [["relation", "location", "1725"], ["relation", "name", "1755"], ["literal", "abstract", "The Temple Society of Concord, commonly referred to as Temple Concord, is a Reform Jewish congregation located at 910 Madison Street, Syracuse, New York.

He is probably famous for his voice performance as Doc the Head Dwarf in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. As well as his film work, he appeared in several Broadway productions, including The Little Missus, The Mimic World, Oh, My Dear!, The Firefly, and How's Your Health? He was a member of the Fortune Gallo's San Carlo Opera Company, and joined ASCAP in 1957. He composed the popular song Some Little Bug is Going to Find You. He was married three times, to Blanche West (1907-?), Dorothy Young (1913\u20131916), and Ethel Smith (1916\u20131936). Roy Atwell, son of Joseph Addison Atwell, is a direct descendant of Joseph Atwell (1754\u20131834), a revolutionary war soldier who in 1792 purchased land in the military tract in New York State that was then the frontier and built a house (\"Atwell's Corners\") in what today is known as Pompey Hollow south of Syracuse, New York, near Cazenovia. He wrote the words to a song, \"When a Piece of Toast Climbs Your Bedpost with a Cigar.\" When Atwell began working on Broadway, he had a role in which he was to deliver the following line: \"It is spring and all the little birds are twittering in the tree tops.\" Being new and somewhat on edge, what Atwell actually did say was: \"Tis ting and the twits are birdering in the tree flops.\" Atwell fully expected to be fired, but the misdelivered line drew a big laugh from the audience and he was asked to repeat it the next night.

After earning a B.S. from New York University, Friedman entered into graduate study at Columbia University and New York University. In the course of her professional career, she was employed by New York American and several other newspapers and magazines. In 1930 she began writing poetry for the Norcross Greeting Card Company, and was eventually promoted to editor. Friedman lived in New York City, and set much of her fiction there. She wrote often about girls in supportive, working-class or middle-class families.

The Republic of China, originally based in mainland China, now governs the island of Taiwan, which constitutes more than 99% of its territory, as well as Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other minor islands, following its loss of the mainland China territory in 1949 in the Chinese Civil War. This remaining area is also constitutionally called the \"Free area of the Republic of China\" which is not ruled by the Communist Party of China in Beijing. Neighboring states include the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the west (mainland China), Japan to the east and northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a population density of 649 people per km2 in October 2015. Taipei is the seat of the central government, and together with the surrounding cities of New Taipei and Keelung forms the largest metropolitan area on the island. The island of Taiwan (formerly known as \"Formosa\") was mainly inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines until the Dutch and Spanish settlement during the Age of Discovery in the 17th century, when Han Chinese began immigrating to the island. In 1662, the pro-Ming loyalist Koxinga expelled the Dutch and established the first Han Chinese polity on the island, the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing dynasty of China later defeated the kingdom and annexed Taiwan. By the time Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895, the majority of Taiwan's inhabitants were Han Chinese either by ancestry or by assimilation. The Republic of China (ROC) was established in mainland China in 1912. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the ROC gained control of Taiwan. During the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party of China took full control of mainland China and founded the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. ROC loyalists fled to Taiwan and re-established the national government there, claiming to be the legitimate government of all of China. Effective ROC jurisdiction was actually now limited to Taiwan and its surrounding islands, with the main island making up 99% of its de facto territory. The ROC continued to represent China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China's seat via Resolution 2758. The ROC lost UN membership. International recognition of the ROC gradually eroded as most countries switched their 'China' recognition to the PRC. 21 UN member states and the Holy See currently maintain official diplomatic relations with the ROC. Numerous other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices via institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. In the 1980s and early 1990s Taiwanese society transformed itself from a military dictatorship employing one-party rule to a multi-party democracy with universal suffrage. Today Taiwan maintains an advanced industrial economy as a result of rapid economic growth and industrialization in the late twentieth century. Taiwan is one of the Four Asian Tigers and a member of the WTO and APEC. The 21st-largest economy in the world, its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy. Taiwan is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, health care, public education, economic freedom, and human development. The complications of Taiwan's history since 1945 have bequeathed a number of unresolved issues to its citizens. Outstanding among these are the exact nature of Taiwanese national identity, the ambiguous international status of Taiwan, and the difficulty of maintaining relations with the PRC across the Taiwan Strait. Within Taiwanese society these issues generate debate among political parties and candidates. Though the ROC renounced in 1992 the conquest of PRC-controlled territories as a national goal, there is still dispute over whether the constitution still gives legal support to a claim of sovereignty over all of China's pre-1949 territories, including Outer Mongolia and the entirety of the present PRC. In practical terms, settlement of questions such as whether the ROC identifies more as \"Taiwan\" or \"China\", and what the exact nature of its identity is relative to the PRC (whether international or domestic), rests with the political coalition most recently elected. Meanwhile, the PRC continues to assert that it represents the sole legal government of \"China\" and that Taiwan represents China's 23rd province. The stance denies Taiwan recognition as a sovereign state. The PRC has threatened the use of military force as a response to any formal declaration by Taiwan of national independence or to any decision by PRC leaders that peaceful annexation of Taiwan is no longer possible."], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/areaTotal", "36193.0"], ["literal", "populationDensityKm", "649"], ["literal", "largestCity", "New Taipei City"], ["literal", "imageFlag", "Flag of the Republic of China.svg"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "President of the Republic of China"], ["literal", "flag", "Flag of the Republic of China.svg"], ["literal", "longName", "Republic of China"], ["literal", "establishedDate", "1912-01-01"], ["literal", "areaKm", "36193"], ["literal", "populationEstimate", "23476640"], ["literal", "leaderTitle", "Premier"], ["literal", "populationDensity", "649"], ["literal", "languages", "Traditional Chinese characters"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "https://archive.org/details/islandofformosap00davi"], ["literal", "officialLanguage", "Standard Chinese"], ["literal", "timeZone", "Time in Taiwan"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg?width=300"], ["literal", "populationDensitySqMi", "1680"], ["literal", "language", "Traditional Chinese characters"], ["literal", "leader", "Chang San-cheng"], ["literal", "demonym", "Taiwanese people"], ["literal", "PopulatedPlace/populationDensity", "649.0"], ["literal", "officialLanguages", "Standard Chinese"], ["literal", "ethnicGroup", "Hoklo people"], ["literal", "ethnicGroups", "\u221f 70%"], ["literal", "areaTotal", "36193000000"], ["literal", "regionalLanguage", "Fuzhou dialect"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "25734"], ["literal", "foundingDate", "1912-01-01"], ["literal", "populationTotal", "23476640"], ["literal", "areaSqMi", "13974"], ["literal", "nativeName", "Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "George Cressey", "neighbors": [["relation", "deathPlace", "1725"], ["relation", "placeOfDeath", "1725"], ["literal", "award", "American Geographical Society"], ["literal", "birthPlace", "Tiffin, Ohio"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "23065784"], ["literal", "birthDate", "1896-12-15"], ["literal", "almaMater", "Clark University"], ["literal", "field", "Geography"], ["literal", "dateOfBirth", "1896-12-15"], ["literal", "abstract", "George Babcock Cressey (December 15, 1896 - October 21, 1963) was an American geographer, author, and academic.

During the 1960s Winkelstein was considered one of the leading epidemiologists of the time. Winkelstein was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of a prominent lawyer. After graduating from the Putney School, he served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He subsequently attended the University of North Carolina, where he majored in sociology. He then attended Syracuse University for medical school, graduating in 1947. He also obtained a Master's of Public Health from Columbia University in 1950. After working in Buffalo, New York for several years under Abraham Morris Lilienfeld, he accepted an appointment at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as Dean of the school from 1972 to 1981. Winkelstein has made important contributions in a number of areas of epidemiology. Early in his academic career, he participated in clinical trials of the polio vaccine. During his time in Buffalo, Winkelstein studied the health impact of the city's air pollution, successfully separating the effect of pollution from other confounding social and environmental factors, and also contributed greatly to the understanding of coronary artery disease in women. At Berkeley, Winkelstein did pioneering research on the link between tobacco smoke and cervical cancer. It took over two decades for those findings to be widely accepted. In the 1980s and thereafter, Winkelstein's work was focused mainly on HIV and the AIDS pandemic. Winkelstein led the San Francisco Men's Health Study, one of the largest and best-described cohorts of people at risk for HIV/AIDS. By studying this cohort, Winkelstein and his collaborators were able to contribute greatly to the understanding of the epidemiology of HIV and AIDS, in particular the modes of viral transmission, risk factors for progression to AIDS, and duration of the incubation period. Winkelstein also addressed Peter Duesberg's arguments that AIDS was related to drug use rather than HIV infection, demonstrating, along with immunologist Michael Ascher and other colleagues, that \"such claims have no basis in fact.\" Since retiring and assuming emeritus status, Winkelstein worked on biographical sketches of major figures in the history of epidemiology, including John Snow, Edward Jenner, and his mentor, Abraham Lilienfeld.

The state has a maritime border in the Atlantic Ocean with Rhode Island, east of Long Island, as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the west and north. The state of New York, with an estimated 19.8 million residents in 2015, is often referred to as New York State to distinguish it from New York City, the state's most populous city and its economic hub. With an estimated population of nearly 8.5 million in 2014, New York City is the most populous city in the United States and the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. The New York City Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. New York City is a global city, exerting a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term New York minute. The home of the United Nations Headquarters, New York City is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world, as well as the world's most economically powerful city. New York City makes up over 40% of the population of New York State. Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York City Metropolitan Area, and nearly 40% live on Long Island. Both the state and New York City were named for the 17th century Duke of York, future King James II of England. The next four most populous cities in the state are Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, while the state capital is Albany. The earliest Europeans in New York were French colonists and Jesuit missionaries who arrived southward from settlements at Montreal for trade and proselytizing. New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time Dutch settlers moved into the region in the early 17th century. In 1609, the region was first claimed by Henry Hudson for the Dutch, who built Fort Nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the colony of New Netherland, a multicultural community from its earliest days and a center of trade and immigration. The British annexed the colony from the Dutch in 1664. The borders of the British colony, the Province of New York, were similar to those of the present-day state. Many landmarks in New York are well known to both international and domestic visitors, with New York State hosting four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, Niagara Falls (shared with Ontario), and Grand Central Terminal. New York is home to the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.

A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. The nation is an area in the geographic region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia and parts of the Russian federal subjects of Leningrad Oblast, Murmansk Oblast, and the Republic of Karelia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level with only about 9% increase in 24 years since the last economic depression in 1990. The majority live in the southern regions. The single largest group of foreigners living in Finland are Russians and Estonians, 36% of all of the foreigners (2014). In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki, local governments in 317 municipalities, and an autonomous region, the \u00c5land Islands. Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, which produces a third of the country's GDP. From the late 12th century, Finland was an integral part of Sweden, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status. In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson (1791\u20131858), \"Swedes we are no-longer, Russians we do not want to become, let us therefore be Finns\", the Finnish national identity started to establish. Nevertheless, in 1809 Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1906, Finland became the second nation in the world to give the right to vote to all adult citizens and the first in the world to give full suffrage to all adult citizens. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Finland declared itself independent. In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by civil war, with the Bolshevik-leaning \"Reds\" supported by the equally new Soviet Union, fighting the \"Whites,\" supported by the German Empire. After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom, the country became a republic. World War II brought several battles along the border with German-occupied Soviet Union. Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality. The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War era. It joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1969, the NATO Partnership for Peace on 1994, the European Union in 1995, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council on 1997 and finally the Eurozone at its inception in 1999. Finland was a relative latecomer to industrialisation, remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s. It rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive Nordic-style welfare state, resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. However, since 2012 Finnish GDP growth has been negative, with a preceding nadir of -8% in 2009. Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development. In 2015, Finland was ranked first in the World Human Capital and the Press Freedom Index, and as the most stable country in the world in the Failed States Index.

He batted .247 in 107 career games, with five home runs and 33 runs batted in. In 1959, he backed up regular Cincinnati catcher Ed Bailey, hitting .267 with two homers and 17 RBI in 161 at-bats. At the close of the 1960 season, he was traded to the Kansas City Athletics, who then left him unprotected in the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft. Dotterer was acquired by Washington with the 12th pick in the player lottery. Dotterer made the 1961 Senators' opening day roster and logged 19 at-bats with them, but on April 30 of that season he played his final MLB game.

She moved to New York City and became an actress, appearing first in several revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan musicals beginning at age 18. In New York in 1931, Brand was one of the founders of the Group Theatre, described by the New York Times as \"a radical company that dealt with social issues confronting the United States during the Depression.\" Her roles included Hennie Berger in Clifford Odets's Awake and Sing! in 1935 and the role of Anna in his Golden Boy in 1937. She created the role of Minny Belle in Kurt Weill's Johnny Johnson in 1936. She summered at Pine Brook Country Club in Nichols, Connecticut, with the Group Theatre in 1936. She married Morris Carnovsky, an actor and fellow member of the Group Theatre, moved to Hollywood in 1940. They married in 1941. They had one child, Stephen Carnovsky, and she raised a niece as well. She continued to use her maiden name professionally. In 1952, during the McCarthy era's campaign against Communist influence in the entertainment industry, director Elia Kazan identified the couple as Communists when he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee. They were consequently blacklisted and generally unable to work in film and on stage. In 1953, they both appeared off-Broadway in The World of Sholem Aleichem as part of a cast of blacklisted actors that was assembled to demonstrate that the New York theater audience would not make them outcasts. It ran for two years. Decades later she recalled this period of her life as a \"killingly frightening\" time. Instead she became an acting teacher and taught acting in New York until she died. Her husband returned to work on the stage in the late 1950s, and in the early 1960s she co-founded an acting troupe that presented classic plays in both English and Spanish in New York's poor neighborhoods, Theater in the Street. She served as the group's artistic director. In 1969, her husband starred and she played a small role in Tyrone Guthrie's production of Lamp at Midnight on a U.S. tour. In 1994, she appeared in Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street, a film that documents a collaborative effort to stage Chekhov's play Uncle Vanya.

Kaufman began recording in 1914, and recorded for Victor, Columbia, Vocalion, Gennett, Edison, Harmony, as well as all of the dime labels (Banner, Perfect, etc.). Early in his career, when recording for Edison and RCA Victor, he recorded under his own name, but he also used a number of (non-Jewish-sounding) aliases. Sometimes, as in the case of several of his 1927 \"Broadway Bell-Hops\" vocals, he was merely credited as \"Vocal Chorus\". He was often credited as \"vocal refrain by George Beaver\" on the dime store labels. Kaufman was a singer in the vaudeville style; certainly not considered a jazz singer, he nonetheless sang on recordings accompanied by some of the foremost jazz figures of the 1920s, including Leon \"Bix\" Beiderbecke, Frank Trumbauer, The Dorsey Brothers, Red Nichols, Miff Mole, and Eddie Lang. His voice recorded well - both acoustically and electrically - and was one of the most prolific singers during the 1920s. Kaufman retired after a heart attack in 1949, and made no further commercial recordings until 1974, when a 2-LP set titled Reminisce With Irving Kaufman was released. It consisted mostly of transcriptions of his old recordings, but included several new cuts of Kaufman singing, accompanied by his second wife, Belle Brooks (1904\u201393).

Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) 170 lb., Corridon was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Newport, Rhode Island. The invention of the spitball has been credited to several pitchers. Corridon is one of them. He claimed to have originated the pitch while playing for the Providence Grays of the International League, when discovered that a ball which had landed in a puddle and was wet on one side did an unexpected effect on its flight when he threw it. He later wet the ball during games and went on to have a respectable major league career. Corridon entered the majors in 1904 with the Chicago Cubs, appearing for them in 24 games before joining the Philadelphia Phillies (1904\u20131905, 1907\u20131909) and St. Louis Cardinals (1910). His most productive season came with the 1907 Phillies, when he posted career-numbers in wins (18), starts (32), complete games (23) and innings pitched (274.0), while collecting a 2.46 ERA.

Born in Germany, Klein immigrated to the United States in 1853. He settled in Syracuse, New York, and worked in the clothing business. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted as a private in the 101st Regiment and later served in Company E of the 40th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Klein's brother, Philip, also served in the war, with the 149th New York Infantry. At some point during his military service Henry Klein was captured and held as a prisoner of war by the Confederates, although the details of this event are unknown. In one battle, after General Gustavus Sniper was wounded, Klein caught the general's horse and helped him dismount. At the Battle of Sayler's Creek, Virginia, on April 6, 1865, his company was ordered to attack a Confederate position. Under heavy canister and musket fire, Klein rushed ahead of the attack, grabbed a Confederate banner from the flag bearer's hands, and returned safely back to Union lines. For this act, he was commended and granted a furlough. On his way home to Syracuse, Klein stopped in Washington, D.C., for a few days.

Biasone, who was a childhood immigrant to the United States from Italy, was mostly known for advocating the use of the shot clock in basketball. Biasone was posthumously inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000 for his contributions to the sport. Although he did not originate the idea of a shot clock, he strongly supported its adoption in professional basketball. Biasone successfully lobbied the NBA to institute the shot clock in 1954. He was responsible for establishing the NBA shot clock at twenty-four seconds, where it has remained to this day. He supported the twenty-four second rule on the basis of his observations, experience, and basic arithmetic. Biasone asserted that basketball proved most exciting when it achieved a balance between stalling contests and wild shootouts. He envisioned a well-paced match up in which each team took around sixty shots per game. Given that professional basketball games lasted forty-eight minutes, Biasone divided 2880 (the number of seconds in forty-eight minutes) by 120 (the total number of shots taken per game when each team attempted sixty shots) and arrived at a figure he considered optimal: one shot every 24 seconds. Additionally, he was also a primary force in convincing the NBA to adopt the backcourt foul rule in 1953. Biasone was featured in the book, Basketball History in Syracuse, Hoops Roots by author Mark Allen Baker published by The History Press in 2010.

Mulroy was born to Morris, a dairy farmer, and Elizabeth, a former schoolteacher. His father served as the Marcellus supervisor on the Onondaga County Board of Supervisors from 1937 to 1953, when the senior Mulroy died in office. Mulroy served as a bomber pilot in the United States Air Force for three years during World War II, and was married September 15, 1945 to the former Virginia Spaulding. He graduated with a degree in history from the University College of Syracuse University and initially earned a living by delivering milk from his family's dairy. He began his political career by getting elected to his father's old position on the County Board of Supervisors, starting in 1957 and rising to Chairman of the Board in 1961. In the 1961 election, Onondaga County voters approved the adoption of a new county charter which provided for the creation of the office of county executive. The Board of Supervisors appointed then-Chairman Mulroy as the first county executive to serve a one-year term before the office was to become elective. In 1962, the electorate voted Mulroy into his first elected term in office, which lasted five years. His achievements in office include: Mulroy was investigated several times for corruption between 1977 and 1982.. He was ultimately convicted of misdemeanors and fined. Mulroy announced his intention to retire in 1987. In his retirement, he served on the boards of several not-for-profit organizations, notably the Onondaga Historical Association, to which he donated a quarter of a million dollars. Mulroy was stricken while on a Syracuse Newspapers-sponsored fishing trip in the Thousand Islands and was taken to Kingston General Hospital. He died after two days. He is buried in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery in the Town of Marcellus. The Onondaga County Civic Center is named in his honor. His son, former Judge J.

In a recent appearance (June 19, 2014), Altman played a card trick where, after Letterman displayed much doubt in the authenticity of the trick, he isolated and found the card that Letterman picked and signed. Altman mesmerized contemporaries like David Letterman and Jerry Seinfeld, and inspired future comedians like Judd Apatow. Altman has also had numerous acting roles in movies and television such as Dr. Gene Splicer in Tiny Toon Adventures, Professor Dweeb in Slimer and The Real Ghostbusters, Clint Mullet on Mork and Mindy, and is perhaps best known for his recurring role as Hughie Hogg, the nephew of Jefferson Davis Hogg, on The Dukes of Hazzard. Altman was a TV cast member in the 1977 Starland Vocal Band Show, and later appeared as sleazy record promoter Lennie Richfield in the movie American Hot Wax in 1978. Altman also had a starring role as the host of the short-lived NBC variety show Pink Lady and Jeff in 1980, which TV Guide has ranked #35 on its \"50 Worst TV Shows of All Time\" list. Later in the decade, he became the in-house comedian of Solid Gold, where his characters included Al Punker, fast-talking proprietor of \"Al Punker's Music Barn,\" the \"music vampire Count Downula,\" and the ex-boxer Leonard Moon, the last of whom would state \"I don't have the brains of a ice cube\" and claim, \"I am the Solid Gold music critic. Tonight, my subject is music.\" Altman has directed many sitcoms, and in the mid-1980s he was the spokesman for Arby's restaurants. He also has been the (uncredited) host of the defensive driving course available through Blockbuster Video. In the 1990s, Altman was on the NBC series Nurses during its first season (1991\u20131992). He was written out as the show was re-worked for its second season. A regular feature of his stand-up act has typically included a comical impression of his father, and he[who?] continued to find his Nixon impression humorous well into the 1980s.[citation needed]"], ["literal", "occupation", "Actor/Comedian"], ["literal", "yearsactive", "1976"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "704874814"], ["literal", "birthPlace", "Syracuse, New York, U.S."], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.delafont.com/comedians/Jeff-Altman.htm"], ["literal", "wordnet type", "http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-actor-noun-1"], ["literal", "activeYearsStartYear", "1976"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Thom Filicia", "neighbors": [["relation", "birthPlace", "1858"], ["relation", "name", "1799"], ["literal", "birthYear", "1969"], ["literal", "birthName", "Thomas L.

The house, Greek Revival in design, was built by and for Hamilton White, Esq circa 1840/42, and occupied by his family in 1842/43. Many believe based on similarities in structure and style that the unknown architect and builder was the same person who designed and built the Moses Burnett House, completed in early 1842, later to become the Syracuse Century Club building. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 due to its significance in the area of architecture and its relationship, through Hamilton White, to the commerce and politics of Syracuse. Hamilton White, born in 1807, lived at the White House until his death in 1865; his family retained ownership until 1911/12, although the building briefly housed the Kanatenah Club. The house is the last of a number of National Register of Historic Places-listed residential structures, in original construction and exterior, remaining in the immediate vicinity of downtown, along the city's Fayette (later, Fireman's) Park. In 1976 it was purchased by an investment group and converted into business offices. In 2002, it was sold to a private environmental firm, but remains offices for lawyers and other small businesses. The White family was prominent in central New York. Hamilton White was the third son of John (also referred to as 'Asa') White, a farmer and gristmill owner in Homer. Hamilton White became a lawyer, farmer, investor and businessman, and moved to Syracuse after a legal apprenticeship in Buffalo, with his wife Sarah Randolf Rich. Together, they raised five children. White co-founded the Syracuse Bank, the Syracuse Coarse Salt Company (Syracuse was a principal supplier of salt in America), and became trustee for and investor in both the Erie Canal and the New York Central Railroad, as well as numerous commercial businesses, some that he founded. He was active in numerous community leadership roles, especially religious and social-welfare issues. He was a leading philanthropist, he, his family and descendants supporting many community, religious and civic organizations, including founding or co-founding Syracuse University's Crouse College, Cornell University, St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, the Orphan's Home, now Elmcrest Children's Home, and the Syracuse Home Association, originally a multi-faith consortium to provide community and social services, especially for the poor, now a provider of long-term healthcare and elder-care services. The family supported the abolishment of slavery, quietly funding black churches and the underground railroad and recruited national speakers to visit Syracuse during the 1850s. He also supported the efforts of Dr. Samuel May, the founder of May Memorial Unitarian Universalist Church. The local United Way leadership campaign, the Hamilton White Society, is named for the family's philanthropy and community development support. Created in 1988, The Hamilton White Society is the United Way's national model for leadership in small and medium-sized communities. The most prominent of his five children, Hamilton Salisbury White (1853\u20131899), was also a lawyer, real estate owner, investor, businessman, who dedicated his life to be a professional firefighter, and later became a city fire commissioner. He funded his own fire company becoming the first paid and professional firehouse in the world. Among White's many contributions to safety and equipment design, White is also acknowledged for first initiating the concept of \"response time\" into firefighting and life-saving techniques. His interest started at an early age. As early as age four, he boarded his pony cart in the stables behind the house and rushed out to watch the volunteer firefighters of the city; watching their efforts shaped his future life. Later, as a student at Cornell, he stabled a horse outside his dorm room, so he could visit fires and watch the volunteer firemen in Ithaca, NY. After graduation from Cornell University, Hamilton S. White returned to Syracuse, developed the city's first public, mechanical and electric fire alarm systems, copied after Ithaca's mechanical system, and built his firehouse at the former 400 Genesee Street, close to the family house. Here, he boarded and trained his fire company, provided all the firefighters' equipment and support,paid the men's salaries, and educated the company in science and techniques of building construction/structural design, fire science and basic chemistry, since many fires were chemically-based. He continually focused on the firefighters' education and improvement in what he regarded as a \"science of firefighting.\" His company worked seven days on, seven off. He is credited with re-designing the firefighter's \"turnout suit,\" creating the first second-floor dormitory with the \"fireman's pole\" for fast access to the engine from the dormitory sleeping quarters, integrating the world's first electric/mechanical alarm system into the firehouse, as well as numerous other safety inventions. He integrated the alarm system into the door-gate using counterweights to lower the horse collars, also counter-weighting the sheets and blankets into the dormitory fly-space (the reason early firehouses had high ceilings), lined horse stalls with plush carpeting, and provided a library as well as a custom carved pool table for the men's recreation. White is credited with the first practical use of the concept of \"response time\". Others have also taken credit with the original idea, but White challenged his company (who were mostly second sons of farmers) to arrive at a reported fire site before he could ride from his home or a community event to the fire's location, usually under five minutes. The normal arrival period for volunteers was 20 or more minutes. White, himself, would arrive at a fire, dressed in his turnout and equipment, before his company, coming from his home or a community function. He had realized the importance of early arrival in saving lives and property. That he recognized this imperative and used his firehouse as a training center for fire fighting technique and sciences resulted in his being characterized as the first \"gentleman fireman\" and the \"world's first professional firefighter\". Ironically, White died in 1899 fighting a downtown chemical fire - most probably from a heart attack induced by toxic fumes from burning chemicals stored in the rear of the structure. He died at the nearby Dawson's Pharmacy in downtown Syracuse. The White family remained in the house until 1911; the property was sold out of family ownership in 1912 and later belonged to a neighboring church and various businesses. Detailed information on both the house and White family is available in the Onondaga Historic Association. The park across from the house (Fireman's Park, but known by its original name of Fayette Park) was used to fence in farm animals for the several park-side residences. It was later converted to a city park and today is the site of a number of statues and monuments to fallen firefighters, including the Hamilton White Monument, designed by Gail Sherman Corbett and built in 1904. Sherman, a native Syracusean, was one of the first independent female architects and designers in the US. Other prominent family members included: Horace K White (banking, salt industry), Horace White, II (NYS Senator, Lt. Governor, Governor), Howard Ganson White (Syracuse Standard newspaper founder/publisher), Adelaide, wife of Hamilton S. (singer, inventor), Hamilton Howard White (founder of Hamilton White Insurance Company, real estate), Kathrine Cook White (pioneer radio broadcaster), Andrew Dickson White (diplomat, ambassador, Cornell University's co-founder and first president), Andrew White Swift (painter), Andrew White Swift II (news critic), Ernest I White, an attorney and Syracuse University Law School sponsor/funding, Hamilton White Wright (travel writer, playwright, US/European amateur golf champion), Hamilton S White, Esq (Syracuse law firm Hancock & Estabrook) and Hamilton S White, Jr. (banking, law, corporate governance, enterprise risk management). The family owned a number of historic landmark buildings: The Hamilton and Horace White Memorial Building (1876), the original property at the current Chimes Building, the White House/Farm (later, Onondaga Golf and Country Club and the Lyndon Golf Courses), five historic mansions, three along Syracuse's prestigious James Street and two more in the nearby village of Fayetteville, New York, and various commercial properties throughout downtown Syracuse. At his death in 1899, Hamilton Salisbury White also left his widow, Adelaide, 46 residential properties designed or rebuilt by renowned architect Ward Wellington Ward, plus other homes built by other well known local architects. White bought these properties from fire victims, rebuilt them at his personal cost, and allowed the victim families rent-free use, until those former owners could in turn repurchase them at cost, or chose to move to other quarters."], ["literal", "wordnet type", "http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-location-noun-1"], ["literal", "nrhpReferenceNumber", "73001238"], ["literal", "yearOfConstruction", "1845"], ["literal", "location", "307"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Danny Schayes", "neighbors": [["relation", "birthPlace", "1725"], ["relation", "name", "483"], ["literal", "activeYearsEndYear", "1999"], ["literal", "termPeriod", "Danny Schayes  7"], ["literal", "activeYearsStartYear", "1981"], ["literal", "years", "\u2013"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "701630984"], ["literal", "team", "Milwaukee Bucks"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.orangehoops.org/DSchayes.htm"], ["literal", "abstract", "Daniel Leslie Schayes (born May 10, 1959) is a retired American professional basketball player who played in the NBA from 1981 until 1999.

Formed in 1962, The Monterays were well established on the Syracuse scene in the 1960s, and after a decade layoff in the 1970s, continue to play over 100 dates a year. The band was formed in East Syracuse, New York in 1962 by Jack Abert (bass guitar/Hawaiian guitar), John Wisnewski (guitar/vocals), Larry Landry (rhythm guitar) and Jack Holton, who was soon replaced by Tommy Forrest (drums/lead vocals). Early inspirations were The Beach Boys, surf music and the theatrics of East Syracuse's first rock and roll band, The Sabres, featuring the talented lead guitarist Ron Lauback. The Monterays developed a loyal following with Syracuse teenagers, so much so that they found themselves at Riposo Studios in the fall of 1964 to wax their first single, the Beatles meets Beach Boys original \"Bye Bye\", and the Larry Santos penned \"Sheryl-ane\". (\"Sheryl-ane\" was also recorded by Utica, New York act The Madisons for MGM Records in 1965)After this single came and went, The Monterays signed a management deal with \"Dandy\" Dan Leonard, a popular disc jockey for WNDR (1965). He was able to arrange another recording sessions for the band, this time in New York City, which resulted in the Larry Santos penned \"I'll Be Around\" on the A side, with the Madisons on side B. The single was released on the Twin Hit label, and went on to sell 500 copies in Upstate New York. At this point Landry and Forrest departed (both joined the military) and were replaced by Dan Elliott (n\u00e9e Rubado) (lead vocals)and Dave Moziak (rhythm guitar) (ex-The Dimensions) and drummer Dave Usiatynski (Tommy Forrest took up the lead vocal duties for another popular Syracuse band The Saint and the Sinners also featuring guitarist Ron Lauback). This is the version of The Monterays that created the most buzz around New York State. Things seemed to be looking up, Dan Leonard booked them into various clubs and live functions (scoring a major coup by getting the band an opening slot on the Beach Boys concert at the Syracuse War Memorial in July 1966. The third single \"Very Last Day\"/\"You Belong To My Heart\" (Sahara Rec. #118) was released in late 1966 and sold about as well the last one. The Monterays scored another coup by wooing away keyboardist George Day from The Saint and the Sinners just in time to record their fourth single \"If Wishes Were Horses\"/\"Conquistador\". The single was recorded again at Riposo Studios, produced by Dan Leonard and the A side featured Thomas Bacon on French Horn. Released on the tiny Buff Records label, \"If Wishes Were Horses\" (Buff # 323681) took off regionally, and The Monterays soon found themselves on A&M Records's radar. A&M ultimately passed, preferring to sign the band Procol Harum instead (\"Conquistador\" was written by Procol Harum members Brooker/Reid but recorded by The Monterays first). Without the promotional support of a major label, \"If Wishes were Horses\" peaked at ##88 on the Cashbox charts in October 1968. By this time, The Monterays (Elliott/Abert/Moziak/Wisnewski/Usiatynski/Day) were now a seven piece, with Tommy Forrest returning on vocals. Unfortunately, family and outside interests began to tear the band apart, and The Monterays split in 1969. Dan Elliott resurfaced with the rock band Wilksbury Brigade, before joining The Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1973. A year later, he joined The Belmonts (of Dion and the Belmonts fame) and continues to perform with them. George Day opened Dayson Studios, recording many top Upstate New York musicians from 1970-1987. George Day also became involved with Ron Wray who curated the Syracuse area artists rock and roll album series in the 1970s and '80s. Tommy Forrest remained active as well, fronting local act The Seven into the early 70s. In 1978, The \"Wishes\"-era Monterays reformed for a one off show at The Beginning club in Syracuse NY to over two thousand people. But after Dan Elliott left California after finishing work on H.B. Halicki's film The Junkman, he reformed The Monterays permanently. Now called Dan Elliott and the Monterays, they've been a mainstay on the Syracuse scene since, recording a single for the Belmonts-owned AIR Records label (\"Stay Awhile\"/\"Ruby Baby\" 1983), and winning a SAMMY (Syracuse Area Music Awards) lifetime achievement award in 1996. The group has undergone some major changes in recent years, with the departures of Jack Abert in 2002 (Jack stayed on as executive producer and live sound mixer), George Day in 2004, and Dave Moziak in 2005. Ron Lauback joined the band in 2002 first as a replacement for Jack Abert, then switching to lead guitar in 2005 with the departure of Dave Moziak. His son Ronnie Dark was added on drums in 2003. Other members in the 2000s included Rob Medugno on keyboards (2005\u20132007), Brian Carr (bass/vocals 2005-2011), and Wayne Muller (keyboards 2007\u2013present). Founding member Jack Abert died on August 16, 2009 in Florida. Longtime bassist Brian Carr departed in October 2011. The band has reshuffled their line-up again with Ronnie Dark taking over bass guitar duties. Ron's first replacement on drums, Teddy O Ted Boileau left in August 2012. The current line-up is Dan Elliot, Ron Lauback, Ronnie Dark, Wayne Muller and Dave Miller, another former member of the group. 2012 marks The Monterays' 50th year in the music business."], ["literal", "formerBandMember", "Tommy Forrest"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Monterays.jpg?width=300"], ["literal", "background", "group_or_band"], ["literal", "wikiPageExternalLink", "http://www.danelliottandthemonterays.com"], ["literal", "pastMembers", "Tommy Forrest"], ["literal", "currentMembers", "Wayne Muller"], ["literal", "alias", "Dan Elliott and the Monterays"], ["literal", "alias", "Dan Elliott and the Monterays (current name)"]], "text": ""}, {"name": "Montgomery Street-Columbus Circle Historic District", "neighbors": [["relation", "location", "1725"], ["relation", "name", "1234"], ["literal", "refnum", "80004278"], ["literal", "added", "1980-02-19"], ["literal", "yearOfConstruction", "1846"], ["literal", "wikiPageID", "21247222"], ["literal", "thumbnail", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Columbus_Circle_Syracuse.jpg?width=300"], ["literal", "nrhpReferenceNumber", "80004278"], ["literal", "wikiPageRevisionID", "701105487"], ["literal", "built", "1846"], ["literal", "location", "E.

In June of that year, Alexander and Catalano along with Public Citizen, filed a lawsuit in US District Court charging that the new rules violated the firm's First Amendment rights.
